This is\n  best for those who want to start from an existing virtual machine as the source. You can feed the\n  artifact of this builder back into Packer to iterate on an image.\n\n### Known Issues\n\n#### VMware Workstation Player (Linux)\n\n1. You may encounter issues due to dependencies and configuration requirements on VMware Workstation\n   Player for Linux [^1]:\n\n   - **Dependencies**\n     - Add `qemu-img`. This command is available in the `qemu` package in Red Hat Enterprise Linux,\n       Debian, and derivative distributions.\n     - Add `vmrun`. This command is available from VMware Virtual Infrastructure eXtension (VIX) SDK.\n   - **Configuration**\n\n     Edit the file `/usr/lib/vmware-vix/vixwrapper-config.txt`. The version specified in the fourth\n     column must be changed to match the version in the third column of the output from the\n     `vmplayer -v` command.\n\n     For detailed steps and troubleshooting, refer to [this][known-issues-so] StackOverflow thread.\n\n[^1]: Support for VMware Workstation Player is deprecated and will be removed in a future release.\n      Read more about [discontinuation of VMware Workstation Player][footnote-player-discontinuation].\n      The project will continue to provide bug fixes; however, enhancements for this platform will\n      no longer be addressed.\n\n[^2]: Support for VMware vSphere Hypervisor (ESXi) is deprecated and will be removed in a future release.\n      Please transition to using the [Packer Plugin for VMware vSphere][footnote-packer-plugin-vsphere].\n      The project will continue to provide bug fixes; however, enhancements for this platform will\n      no longer be addressed.\n\n[vsphere-hypervisor]: https://www.vmware.com/products/vsphere-hypervisor.html\n[desktop-hypervisors]: https://www.vmware.com/products/desktop-hypervisor.html\n[known-issues-so]: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/31985348/vix-vmrun-doesnt-work-with-vmware-player\n[footnote-player-discontinuation]: https://blogs.vmware.com/workstation/2024/05/vmware-workstation-pro-now-available-free-for-personal-use.html\n[footnote-packer-plugin-vsphere]: https://developer.hashicorp.com/packer/integrations/hashicorp/vsphere\n","created_at":"2024-08-09T16:58:37.748Z","updated_at":"2024-08-09T16:58:37.748Z","components":[{"id":"3556ef75-e249-4391-b685-6c1e32a2aea2","integration_release_id":"8f8bc2a4-92f3-4c53-81ca-551c5ecba01b","component_id":"36076511-3ced-4faf-addf-101fce0405ff","readme":"Type: `vmware-iso`\n\nThis builder creates a virtual machine, installs an operating system from an ISO, provisions\nsoftware within the operating system, and then exports the virtual machine as an image.

Allowed values are `darwin` (macOS), `linux`,\n  and `windows`. Default is empty and no version will be uploaded.\n\n- `tools_upload_path` (string) - The path in the virtual machine to upload the VMware Tools. This only\n  takes effect if `tools_upload_flavor` is non-empty. This is a\n  [configuration template](/packer/docs/templates/legacy_json_templates/engine)\n  that has a single valid variable, `Flavor`, which will be the value of\n  `tools_upload_flavor` when the upload path is set to `{{.Flavor}}.iso`.\n  \n  ~> **Note:** This setting is not used when `remote_type` is `esx5`.\n\n- `tools_source_path` (string) - The local path on your machine to the VMware Tools ISO file.\n  \n  ~> **Note:** If not set, but the `tools_upload_flavor` is set, the plugin\n  will load the VMware Tools from the product installation directory.\n\n<!-- End of code generated from the comments of the ToolsConfig struct in builder/vmware/common/tools_config.go; -->\n\n\n### Floppy Configuration\n\n<!-- Code generated from the comments of the FloppyConfig struct in multistep/commonsteps/floppy_config.go; DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY -->\n\nA floppy can be made available for your build. This is most useful for\nunattended Windows installs, which look for an Autounattend.xml file on\nremovable media. By default, no floppy will be attached. All files listed in\nthis setting get placed into the root directory of the floppy and the floppy\nis attached as the first floppy device. The summary size of the listed files\nmust not exceed 1.44 MB. The supported ways to move large files into the OS\nare using `http_directory` or [the file\nprovisioner](/packer/docs/provisioner/file).\n\n<!-- End of code generated from the comments of the FloppyConfig struct in multistep/commonsteps/floppy_config.go; -->\n\n\n**Optional**:\n\n<!-- Code generated from the comments of the FloppyConfig struct in multistep/commonsteps/floppy_config.go; DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY -->\n\n- `floppy_files` ([]string) - A list of files to place onto a floppy disk that is attached when the VM\n  is booted. Currently, no support exists for creating sub-directories on\n  the floppy. Wildcard characters (\\\\*, ?, and \\[\\]) are allowed. Directory\n  names are also allowed, which will add all the files found in the\n  directory to the floppy.\n\n- `floppy_dirs` ([]string) - A list of directories to place onto the floppy disk recursively. This is\n  similar to the `floppy_files` option except that the directory structure\n  is preserved. This is useful for when your floppy disk includes drivers\n  or if you just want to organize it's contents as a hierarchy. Wildcard\n  characters (\\\\*, ?, and \\[\\]) are allowed. The maximum summary size of\n  all files in the listed directories are the same as in `floppy_files`.\n\n- `floppy_content` (map[string]string) - Key/Values to add to the floppy disk. The keys represent the paths, and\n  the values contents. It can be used alongside `floppy_files` or\n  `floppy_dirs`, which is useful to add large files without loading them\n  into memory. If any paths are specified by both, the contents in\n  `floppy_content` will take precedence.\n  \n  Usage example (HCL):\n  \n  ```hcl\n  floppy_files = [\"vendor-data\"]\n  floppy_content = {\n    \"meta-data\" = jsonencode(local.instance_data)\n    \"user-data\" = templatefile(\"user-data\", { packages = [\"nginx\"] })\n  }\n  floppy_label = \"cidata\"\n  ```\n\n- `floppy_label` (string) - Floppy Label\n\n<!-- End of code generated from the comments of the FloppyConfig struct in multistep/commonsteps/floppy_config.go; -->\n\n\n### CD-ROM Configuration\n\n<!-- Code generated from the comments of the CDConfig struct in multistep/commonsteps/extra_iso_config.go; DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY -->\n\n- `cd_files` ([]string) - A list of files to place onto a CD that is attached when the VM is\n  booted. This can include either files or directories; any directories\n  will be copied onto the CD recursively, preserving directory structure\n  hierarchy. Symlinks will have the link's target copied into the directory\n  tree on the CD where the symlink was. File globbing is allowed.\n  \n  Usage example (JSON):\n  \n  ```json\n  \"cd_files\": [\"./somedirectory/meta-data\", \"./somedirectory/user-data\"],\n  \"cd_label\": \"cidata\",\n  ```\n  \n  Usage example (HCL):\n  \n  ```hcl\n  cd_files = [\"./somedirectory/meta-data\", \"./somedirectory/user-data\"]\n  cd_label = \"cidata\"\n  ```\n  \n  The above will create a CD with two files, user-data and meta-data in the\n  CD root. This specific example is how you would create a CD that can be\n  used for an Ubuntu 20.04 autoinstall.\n  \n  Since globbing is also supported,\n  \n  ```hcl\n  cd_files = [\"./somedirectory/*\"]\n  cd_label = \"cidata\"\n  ```\n  \n  Would also be an acceptable way to define the above cd. The difference\n  between providing the directory with or without the glob is whether the\n  directory itself or its contents will be at the CD root.\n  \n  Use of this option assumes that you have a command line tool installed\n  that can handle the iso creation.

The files in this\n  directory will be available over HTTP that will be requestable from the\n  virtual machine. This is useful for hosting kickstart files and so on.\n  By default this is an empty string, which means no HTTP server will be\n  started. The address and port of the HTTP server will be available as\n  variables in `boot_command`. This is covered in more detail below.\n\n- `http_content` (map[string]string) - Key/Values to serve using an HTTP server. `http_content` works like and\n  conflicts with `http_directory`. The keys represent the paths and the\n  values contents, the keys must start with a slash, ex: `/path/to/file`.\n  `http_content` is useful for hosting kickstart files and so on.

Because Packer often runs in\n  parallel, Packer will choose a randomly available port in this range to\n  run the HTTP server. If you want to force the HTTP server to be on one\n  port, make this minimum and maximum port the same.

Defaults to `vmx` for local desktop hypervisors\n  and `ova` for remote hypervisors.\n  \n  For builds on a remote hypervisor, `remote_password` must be set when\n  exporting the virtual machine\n  \n  For builds on a local desktop hypervisor, the plugin will create a `.vmx`\n  and export the virtual machine as an `.ovf` or `.ova` file. THe plugin\n  will not delete the `.vmx` and `.vmdk` files. You must manually delete\n  these files if they are no longer needed.\n  \n  ~> **Note:** Ensure VMware OVF Tool is installed. For the latest version,\n  visit [VMware OVF Tool](https://developer.broadcom.com/tools/open-virtualization-format-ovf-tool/latest).\n  \n  ~> **Note:** For local builds, the plugin will create a `.vmx` and\n  supporting files in the output directory and will then export the\n  virtual machine to the specified format. These files are **not**\n  automatically cleaned up after the export process.\n\n- `ovftool_options` ([]string) - Additional command-line arguments to send to VMware OVF Tool during the\n  export process. Each string in the array represents a separate\n  command-line argument.\n  \n  ~> **Important:** The options `--noSSLVerify`, `--skipManifestCheck`, and\n  `--targetType` are automatically applied by the plugin for remote exports\n  and should not be included in the options. For local OVF/OVA exports,\n  the plugin does not preset any VMware OVF Tool options by default.\n  \n  ~> **Note:** Ensure VMware OVF Tool is installed. For the latest version,\n  visit [VMware OVF Tool](https://developer.broadcom.com/tools/open-virtualization-format-ovf-tool/latest).\n\n- `skip_export` (bool) - Skips the export of the virtual machine. This is useful if the build\n  output is not the resultant image, but created inside the virtual\n  machine. This is useful for debugging purposes. Defaults to `false`.\n\n- `keep_registered` (bool) - Determines whether a virtual machine built on a remote hypervisor should\n  remain registered after the build process. Setting this to `true` can be\n  useful if the virtual machine does not need to be exported. Defaults to\n  `false`.\n\n- `skip_compaction` (bool) - At the end of the build process, the plugin defragments and compacts the\n  disks using `vmware-vdiskmanager` or `vmkfstools` for ESXi environments.\n  In some cases, this process may result in slightly larger disk sizes.\n  If this occurs, you can opt to skip the disk compaction step by using\n  this setting. Defaults to `false`.

If relative, the path is relative to\n  the working directory when packer is executed.\n  \n  If you are running a remote hypervisor build, the output_dir is the path on your\n  local machine (the machine running Packer) to which Packer will export\n  the vm if you have `\"skip_export\": false`. If you want to manage the\n  virtual machine's path on the remote datastore, use `remote_output_dir`.\n  \n  This directory must not exist or be empty prior to running\n  the builder.\n  \n  By default this is output-BUILDNAME where \"BUILDNAME\" is the name of the\n  build.\n\n- `remote_output_directory` (string) - This is the directory on your remote hypervisor where you will save your\n  vm, relative to your remote_datastore.\n  \n  This option's default value is your `vm_name`, and the final path of your\n  vm will be vmfs/volumes/$remote_datastore/$vm_name/$vm_name.vmx where\n  `$remote_datastore` and `$vm_name` match their corresponding template\n  options\n  \n  For example, setting `\"remote_output_directory\": \"path/to/subdir`\n  will create a directory `/vmfs/volumes/remote_datastore/path/to/subdir`.\n  \n  Packer will not create the remote datastore for you; it must already\n  exist. However, Packer will create all directories defined in the option\n  that do not currently exist.\n  \n  This option will be ignored unless you are building on a remote hypervisor.\n\n<!-- End of code generated from the comments of the OutputConfig struct in builder/vmware/common/output_config.go; -->\n\n\n### Hypervisor Configuration\n\n**Optional**:\n\n<!-- Code generated from the comments of the DriverConfig struct in builder/vmware/common/driver_config.go; DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY -->\n\n- `fusion_app_path` (string) - Path to \"VMware Fusion.app\". By default this is\n  /Applications/VMware Fusion.app but this setting allows you to\n  customize this.\n\n- `remote_type` (string) - The type of remote machine that will be used to\n  build this VM rather than a local desktop product. The only value accepted\n  for this currently is esx5. If this is not set, a desktop product will\n  be used. By default, this is not set.\n\n- `remote_datastore` (string) - The path to the datastore where the VM will be stored\n  on the ESXi machine.\n\n- `remote_cache_datastore` (string) - The path to the datastore where supporting files\n  will be stored during the build on the remote machine.\n\n- `remote_cache_directory` (string) - The path where the ISO and/or floppy files will\n  be stored during the build on the remote machine. The path is relative to\n  the remote_cache_datastore on the remote machine.\n\n- `cleanup_remote_cache` (bool) - When set to true, Packer will cleanup the cache folder where the ISO file is stored during the build on the remote machine.\n  By default, this is set to false.\n\n- `remote_host` (string) - The host of the remote machine used for access.\n  This is only required if remote_type is enabled.\n\n- `remote_port` (int) - The SSH port of the remote machine\n\n- `remote_username` (string) - The SSH username used to access the remote machine.\n\n- `remote_password` (string) - The SSH password for access to the remote machine.\n\n- `remote_private_key_file` (string) - The SSH key for access to the remote machine.\n\n- `skip_validate_credentials` (bool) - When Packer is preparing to run a\n  remote hypervisor build, and export is not disable, by default it runs a no-op\n  ovftool command to make sure that the remote_username and remote_password\n  given are valid. If you set this flag to true, Packer will skip this\n  validation. Default: false.\n\n<!-- End of code generated from the comments of the DriverConfig struct in builder/vmware/common/driver_config.go; -->\n\n\n### Advanced Configuration\n\n**Optional**:\n\n<!-- Code generated from the comments of the VMXConfig struct in builder/vmware/common/vmx_config.go; DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY -->\n\n- `vmx_data` (map[string]string) - Key-value pairs that will be inserted into the virtual machine `.vmx`\n  file **before** the virtual machine is started. This is useful for\n  setting advanced properties that are not supported by the plugin.\n  \n  ~> **Note**: This option is intended for advanced users who understand\n  the ramifications of making changes to the `.vmx` file. This option is\n  not necessary for most users.\n\n- `vmx_data_post` (map[string]string) - Key-value pairs that will be inserted into the virtual machine `.vmx`\n  file **after** the virtual machine is started.

This option is\n  not necessary for most users.\n\n- `vmx_remove_ethernet_interfaces` (bool) - Remove all network adapters from virtual machine `.vmx` file after the\n  virtual machine build is complete. Defaults to `false`.\n  \n  ~> **Note**: This option is useful when building Vagrant boxes since\n  Vagrant will create interfaces when provisioning a box.\n\n- `display_name` (string) - The inventory display name for the virtual machine. If set, the value\n  provided will override any value set in the `vmx_data` option or in the\n  `.vmx` file. This option is useful if you are chaining builds and want to\n  ensure that the display name of each step in the chain is unique.\n\n<!-- End of code generated from the comments of the VMXConfig struct in builder/vmware/common/vmx_config.go; -->\n\n\n## Boot Configuration\n\n<!-- Code generated from the comments of the BootConfig struct in bootcommand/config.go; DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY -->\n\nThe boot configuration is very important: `boot_command` specifies the keys\nto type when the virtual machine is first booted in order to start the OS\ninstaller. This command is typed after boot_wait, which gives the virtual\nmachine some time to actually load.\n\nThe boot_command is an array of strings. The strings are all typed in\nsequence. It is an array only to improve readability within the template.\n\nThere are a set of special keys available. If these are in your boot\ncommand, they will be replaced by the proper key:\n\n-   `<bs>` - Backspace\n\n-   `<del>` - Delete\n\n-   `<enter> <return>` - Simulates an actual \"enter\" or \"return\" keypress.\n\n-   `<esc>` - Simulates pressing the escape key.\n\n-   `<tab>` - Simulates pressing the tab key.\n\n-   `<f1> - <f12>` - Simulates pressing a function key.\n\n-   `<up> <down> <left> <right>` - Simulates pressing an arrow key.\n\n-   `<spacebar>` - Simulates pressing the spacebar.\n\n-   `<insert>` - Simulates pressing the insert key.\n\n-   `<home> <end>` - Simulates pressing the home and end keys.\n\n  - `<pageUp> <pageDown>` - Simulates pressing the page up and page down\n    keys.\n\n-   `<menu>` - Simulates pressing the Menu key.\n\n-   `<leftAlt> <rightAlt>` - Simulates pressing the alt key.\n\n-   `<leftCtrl> <rightCtrl>` - Simulates pressing the ctrl key.\n\n-   `<leftShift> <rightShift>` - Simulates pressing the shift key.\n\n-   `<leftSuper> <rightSuper>` - Simulates pressing the ⌘ or Windows key.\n\n  - `<wait> <wait5> <wait10>` - Adds a 1, 5 or 10 second pause before\n    sending any additional keys. This is useful if you have to generally\n    wait for the UI to update before typing more.\n\n  - `<waitXX>` - Add an arbitrary pause before sending any additional keys.\n    The format of `XX` is a sequence of positive decimal numbers, each with\n    optional fraction and a unit suffix, such as `300ms`, `1.5h` or `2h45m`.\n    Valid time units are `ns`, `us` (or `µs`), `ms`, `s`, `m`, `h`. For\n    example `<wait10m>` or `<wait1m20s>`.\n\n  - `<XXXOn> <XXXOff>` - Any printable keyboard character, and of these\n    \"special\" expressions, with the exception of the `<wait>` types, can\n    also be toggled on or off. For example, to simulate ctrl+c, use\n    `<leftCtrlOn>c<leftCtrlOff>`. Be sure to release them, otherwise they\n    will be held down until the machine reboots. To hold the `c` key down,\n    you would use `<cOn>`. Likewise, `<cOff>` to release.\n\n  - `{{ .HTTPIP }} {{ .HTTPPort }}` - The IP and port, respectively of an\n    HTTP server that is started serving the directory specified by the\n    `http_directory` configuration parameter. If `http_directory` isn't\n    specified, these will be blank!\n\n-   `{{ .Name }}` - The name of the VM.\n\nExample boot command. This is actually a working boot command used to start an\nCentOS 6.4 installer:\n\nIn JSON:\n\n```json\n\"boot_command\": [\n\n\t   \"<tab><wait>\",\n\t   \" ks=http://{{ .HTTPIP }}:{{ .HTTPPort }}/centos6-ks.cfg<enter>\"\n\t]\n\n```\n\nIn HCL2:\n\n```hcl\nboot_command = [\n\n\t   \"<tab><wait>\",\n\t   \" ks=http://{{ .HTTPIP }}:{{ .HTTPPort }}/centos6-ks.cfg<enter>\"\n\t]\n\n```\n\nThe example shown below is a working boot command used to start an Ubuntu\n12.04 installer:\n\nIn JSON:\n\n```json\n\"boot_command\": [\n\n\t\"<esc><esc><enter><wait>\",\n\t\"/install/vmlinuz noapic \",\n\t\"preseed/url=http://{{ .HTTPIP }}:{{ .HTTPPort }}/preseed.cfg \",\n\t\"debian-installer=en_US auto locale=en_US kbd-chooser/method=us \",\n\t\"hostname={{ .Name }} \",\n\t\"fb=false debconf/frontend=noninteractive \",\n\t\"keyboard-configuration/modelcode=SKIP keyboard-configuration/layout=USA \",\n\t\"keyboard-configuration/variant=USA console-setup/ask_detect=false \",\n\t\"initrd=/install/initrd.gz -- <enter>\"\n\n]\n```\n\nIn HCL2:\n\n```hcl\nboot_command = [\n\n\t\"<esc><esc><enter><wait>\",\n\t\"/install/vmlinuz noapic \",\n\t\"preseed/url=http://{{ .HTTPIP }}:{{ .HTTPPort }}/preseed.cfg \",\n\t\"debian-installer=en_US auto locale=en_US kbd-chooser/method=us \",\n\t\"hostname={{ .Name }} \",\n\t\"fb=false debconf/frontend=noninteractive \",\n\t\"keyboard-configuration/modelcode=SKIP keyboard-configuration/layout=USA \",\n\t\"keyboard-configuration/variant=USA console-setup/ask_detect=false \",\n\t\"initrd=/install/initrd.gz -- <enter>\"\n\n]\n```\n\nFor more examples of various boot commands, see the sample projects from our\n[community templates page](https://packer.io/community-tools#templates).\n\n<!-- End of code generated from the comments of the BootConfig struct in bootcommand/config.go; -->\n\n\n<!-- Code generated from the comments of the VNCConfig struct in bootcommand/config.go; DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY -->\n\nThe boot command \"typed\" character for character over a VNC connection to\nthe machine, simulating a human actually typing the keyboard.\n\nKeystrokes are typed as separate key up/down events over VNC with a default\n100ms delay. The delay alleviates issues with latency and CPU contention.\nYou can tune this delay on a per-builder basis by specifying\n\"boot_key_interval\" in your Packer template.\n\n<!-- End of code generated from the comments of the VNCConfig struct in bootcommand/config.go; -->\n\n\n-> **Note**: For the `HTTPIP` to be resolved, the `network` interface type must\nbe set to either `hostonly` or `nat`. It is recommended to leave the default\nnetwork configuration while you are building the virtual machine, and use the\n`vmx_data_post` hook to modify the network configuration after the virtual\nmachine build is complete.\n\n**Optional**:\n\n<!-- Code generated from the comments of the BootConfig struct in bootcommand/config.go; DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY -->\n\n- `boot_keygroup_interval` (duration string | ex: \"1h5m2s\") - Time to wait after sending a group of key pressses. The value of this\n  should be a duration. Examples are `5s` and `1m30s` which will cause\n  Packer to wait five seconds and one minute 30 seconds, respectively. If\n  this isn't specified, a sensible default value is picked depending on\n  the builder type.\n\n- `boot_wait` (duration string | ex: \"1h5m2s\") - The time to wait after booting the initial virtual machine before typing\n  the `boot_command`. The value of this should be a duration. Examples are\n  `5s` and `1m30s` which will cause Packer to wait five seconds and one\n  minute 30 seconds, respectively. If this isn't specified, the default is\n  `10s` or 10 seconds. To set boot_wait to 0s, use a negative number, such\n  as \"-1s\"\n\n- `boot_command` ([]string) - This is an array of commands to type when the virtual machine is first\n  booted. The goal of these commands should be to type just enough to\n  initialize the operating system installer. Special keys can be typed as\n  well, and are covered in the section below on the boot command. If this\n  is not specified, it is assumed the installer will start itself.\n\n<!-- End of code generated from the comments of the BootConfig struct in bootcommand/config.go; -->\n\n\n<!-- Code generated from the comments of the VNCConfig struct in bootcommand/config.go; DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY -->\n\n- `disable_vnc` (bool) - Whether to create a VNC connection or not.

When this value is set to\n  `true`, the virtual machine will start without a console; however, the\n  plugin will output VNC connection information in case you need to connect\n  to the console to debug the build process. Defaults to `false`.\n  \n  ~> **Note:** Some users have experienced issues where Packer cannot\n  properly connect to a virtual machine when using `headless`. This is\n  often attributed to the use of an evaluation license for VMware desktop\n  hypervisors. It is recommended to launch the product and accept the\n  evaluation license to resolve this if you encounter an issue with this\n  option.\n\n- `vnc_bind_address` (string) - The IP address to use for VNC access to the virtual machine. Defaults to\n  `127.0.0.1`.\n  \n  ~> **Note:** To bind to all interfaces use `0.0.0.0`.\n\n- `vnc_port_min` (int) - The minimum port number to use for VNC access to the virtual machine.\n  The plugin uses VNC to type the `boot_command`. Defaults to `5900`.\n\n- `vnc_port_max` (int) - The maximum port number to use for VNC access to the virtual machine.\n  The plugin uses VNC to type the `boot_command`. Defaults to `6000`.\n  \n  ~> **Note:** The plugin randomly selects port within the inclusive range\n  specified by `vnc_port_min` and `vnc_port_max`.\n\n- `vnc_disable_password` (bool) - Disables the auto-generation of a VNC password that is used to secure the\n  VNC communication with the virtual machine. Defaults to `false`.\n  \n  ~> **Important:** Must be set to `true` for remote hypervisor builds with\n  VNC enabled.\n\n- `vnc_over_websocket` (bool) - Connect to VNC over a websocket connection. Defaults to `false`.\n  \n  ~> **Note:** When set to `true`, any other VNC configuration options will\n  be ignored.\n  \n  ~> **Important:** Must be set to `true` for remote hypervisor builds with\n  VNC enabled.\n\n- `insecure_connection` (bool) - Do not validate TLS certificate when connecting to VNC over a websocket\n  connection. Defaults to `false`.\n\n<!-- End of code generated from the comments of the RunConfig struct in builder/vmware/common/run_config.go; -->\n\n\n~> **Note**: Packer dynamically selects a VNC port for remote builds by scanning a range from\n`vnc_port_min` to `vnc_port_max`. It looks for an available port by checking if\nanything is listening on each port within this range. In environments with\nmultiple clients building on the same ESXi host, there might be competition for\nVNC ports. To manage this, you can adjust the connection timeout with the\n`PACKER_ESXI_VNC_PROBE_TIMEOUT` environment variable. This variable sets the\ntimeout in seconds for each VNC port probe attempt to determine if the port is\navailable. The default is 15 seconds. Decrease this timeout if VNC connections\nare frequently refused, or increase it if Packer struggles to find an open port.\nThis setting is an advanced configuration option and should be used with caution.\nEnsure your firewall settings are appropriately configured before making\nadjustments.\n\n\n### Communicator Configuration\n\n**Optional**:\n\n##### Common\n\n<!-- Code generated from the comments of the Config struct in communicator/config.go; DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY -->\n\n- `communicator` (string) - Packer currently supports three kinds of communicators:\n  \n  -   `none` - No communicator will be used. If this is set, most\n      provisioners also can't be used.\n  \n  -   `ssh` - An SSH connection will be established to the machine. This\n      is usually the default.\n  \n  -   `winrm` - A WinRM connection will be established.\n  \n  In addition to the above, some builders have custom communicators they\n  can use. For example, the Docker builder has a \"docker\" communicator\n  that uses `docker exec` and `docker cp` to execute scripts and copy\n  files.\n\n- `pause_before_connecting` (duration string | ex: \"1h5m2s\") - We recommend that you enable SSH or WinRM as the very last step in your\n  guest's bootstrap script, but sometimes you may have a race condition\n  where you need Packer to wait before attempting to connect to your\n  guest.\n  \n  If you end up in this situation, you can use the template option\n  `pause_before_connecting`. By default, there is no pause. For example if\n  you set `pause_before_connecting` to `10m` Packer will check whether it\n  can connect, as normal. But once a connection attempt is successful, it\n  will disconnect and then wait 10 minutes before connecting to the guest\n  and beginning provisioning.\n\n<!-- End of code generated from the comments of the Config struct in communicator/config.go; -->\n\n\n##### SSH\n\n<!-- Code generated from the comments of the SSH struct in communicator/config.go; DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY -->\n\n- `ssh_host` (string) - The address to SSH to.

This is a\n  mostly cosmetic option, since Packer will delete the temporary private\n  key from the host system regardless of whether this is set to true\n  (unless the user has set the `-debug` flag). Defaults to \"false\";\n  currently only works on guests with `sed` installed.\n\n- `ssh_key_exchange_algorithms` ([]string) - If set, Packer will override the value of key exchange (kex) algorithms\n  supported by default by Golang. Acceptable values include:\n  \"curve25519-sha256@libssh.org\", \"ecdh-sha2-nistp256\",\n  \"ecdh-sha2-nistp384\", \"ecdh-sha2-nistp521\",\n  \"diffie-hellman-group14-sha1\", and \"diffie-hellman-group1-sha1\".\n\n- `ssh_certificate_file` (string) - Path to user certificate used to authenticate with SSH.\n  The `~` can be used in path and will be expanded to the\n  home directory of current user.\n\n- `ssh_pty` (bool) - If `true`, a PTY will be requested for the SSH connection. This defaults\n  to `false`.\n\n- `ssh_timeout` (duration string | ex: \"1h5m2s\") - The time to wait for SSH to become available. Packer uses this to\n  determine when the machine has booted so this is usually quite long.\n  Example value: `10m`.\n  This defaults to `5m`, unless `ssh_handshake_attempts` is set.\n\n- `ssh_disable_agent_forwarding` (bool) - If true, SSH agent forwarding will be disabled. Defaults to `false`.\n\n- `ssh_handshake_attempts` (int) - The number of handshakes to attempt with SSH once it can connect.\n  This defaults to `10`, unless a `ssh_timeout` is set.\n\n- `ssh_bastion_host` (string) - A bastion host to use for the actual SSH connection.\n\n- `ssh_bastion_port` (int) - The port of the bastion host.

The `~` can be used in path and will be expanded to the\n  home directory of current user.\n\n- `ssh_bastion_certificate_file` (string) - Path to user certificate used to authenticate with bastion host.\n  The `~` can be used in path and will be expanded to the\n  home directory of current user.\n\n- `ssh_file_transfer_method` (string) - `scp` or `sftp` - How to transfer files, Secure copy (default) or SSH\n  File Transfer Protocol.\n  \n  **NOTE**: Guests using Windows with Win32-OpenSSH v9.1.0.0p1-Beta, scp\n  (the default protocol for copying data) returns a a non-zero error code since the MOTW\n  cannot be set, which cause any file transfer to fail. As a workaround you can override the transfer protocol\n  with SFTP instead `ssh_file_transfer_method = \"sftp\"`.\n\n- `ssh_proxy_host` (string) - A SOCKS proxy host to use for SSH connection\n\n- `ssh_proxy_port` (int) - A port of the SOCKS proxy. Defaults to `1080`.\n\n- `ssh_proxy_username` (string) - The optional username to authenticate with the proxy server.\n\n- `ssh_proxy_password` (string) - The optional password to use to authenticate with the proxy server.\n\n- `ssh_keep_alive_interval` (duration string | ex: \"1h5m2s\") - How often to send \"keep alive\" messages to the server.

The possible values are 'dsa',\n  'ecdsa', 'ed25519', or 'rsa'.\n  \n  NOTE: DSA is deprecated and no longer recognized as secure, please\n  consider other alternatives like RSA or ED25519.\n\n- `temporary_key_pair_bits` (int) - Specifies the number of bits in the key to create. For RSA keys, the\n  minimum size is 1024 bits and the default is 4096 bits. Generally, 3072\n  bits is considered sufficient. DSA keys must be exactly 1024 bits as\n  specified by FIPS 186-2. For ECDSA keys, bits determines the key length\n  by selecting from one of three elliptic curve sizes: 256, 384 or 521\n  bits. Attempting to use bit lengths other than these three values for\n  ECDSA keys will fail. Ed25519 keys have a fixed length and bits will be\n  ignored.\n  \n  NOTE: DSA is deprecated and no longer recognized as secure as specified\n  by FIPS 186-5, please consider other alternatives like RSA or ED25519.\n\n<!-- End of code generated from the comments of the SSHTemporaryKeyPair struct in communicator/config.go; -->\n\n\n##### Windows Remote Management (WinRM)\n\n<!-- Code generated from the comments of the WinRM struct in communicator/config.go; DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY -->\n\n- `winrm_username` (string) - The username to use to connect to WinRM.\n\n- `winrm_password` (string) - The password to use to connect to WinRM.\n\n- `winrm_host` (string) - The address for WinRM to connect to.\n  \n  NOTE: If using an Amazon EBS builder, you can specify the interface\n  WinRM connects to via\n  [`ssh_interface`](/packer/integrations/hashicorp/amazon/latest/components/builder/ebs#ssh_interface)\n\n- `winrm_no_proxy` (bool) - Setting this to `true` adds the remote\n  `host:port` to the `NO_PROXY` environment variable. This has the effect of\n  bypassing any configured proxies when connecting to the remote host.\n  Default to `false`.\n\n- `winrm_port` (int) - The WinRM port to connect to. This defaults to `5985` for plain\n  unencrypted connection and `5986` for SSL when `winrm_use_ssl` is set to\n  true.\n\n- `winrm_timeout` (duration string | ex: \"1h5m2s\") - The amount of time to wait for WinRM to become available. This defaults\n  to `30m` since setting up a Windows machine generally takes a long time.\n\n- `winrm_use_ssl` (bool) - If `true`, use HTTPS for WinRM.\n\n- `winrm_insecure` (bool) - If `true`, do not check server certificate chain and host name.\n\n- `winrm_use_ntlm` (bool) - If `true`, NTLMv2 authentication (with session security) will be used\n  for WinRM, rather than default (basic authentication), removing the\n  requirement for basic authentication to be enabled within the target\n  guest. Further reading for remote connection authentication can be found\n  [here](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa384295(v=vs.85).aspx).\n\n<!-- End of code generated from the comments of the WinRM struct in communicator/config.go; -->\n\n\n## Building on VMware vSphere Hypervisor\n\nIn addition to using the desktop virtualization products to build virtual\nmachines, this plugin can use a VMware vSphere Hypervisor to build the virtual\nmachine.\n\nBefore using a vSphere Hypervisor, you need to enable `GuestIPHack` by\nrunning the following command:\n\n```shell-session\n$ esxcli system settings advanced set -o /Net/GuestIPHack -i 1\n```\n\nWhen using the vSphere Hypervisor, the builder still downloads the ISO and\nvarious files locally, and uploads these to the remote hypervisore. This plugin\nuses SSH to communicate to the ESXi host rather than the vSphere API. [^2]\n\nThis plugin also requires VNC to issue boot commands during a build. Please\nrefer to the VMware vSphere documentation on how to update the hypervisor's\nfirewall to allow these connections. VNC can be disabled by not setting a\n`boot_command` and setting `disable_vnc` to `true`.\n\nPlease note that you should disable vMotion for the host you intend to run\nbuilds on; a vMotion event will cause the build to fail.\n\nTo run a remote build for your virtual machine image, use the following\nconfigurations:\n\n**Required**:\n\n- [`remote_type`](#hypervisor-configuration)\n- [`remote_host`](#hypervisor-configuration)\n\n**Optional**:\n\n- [`remote_port`](#hypervisor-configuration)\n- [`remote_datastore`](#hypervisor-configuration)\n- [`remote_cache_datastore`](#hypervisor-configuration)\n- [`remote_cache_directory`](#hypervisor-configuration)\n- [`remote_username`](#hypervisor-configuration)\n- [`remote_password`](#hypervisor-configuration)\n- [`remote_private_key_file`](#hypervisor-configuration)\n- [`format`](#export-configuration)\n- [`vnc_disable_password`](#advanced-configuration)\n\n\n### SSH Key Pair Automation\n\nThe builders can inject the current SSH key pair's public key into the template\nusing the `SSHPublicKey` template engine. This is the SSH public key as a line\nin OpenSSH `authorized_keys` format.\n\nWhen a private key is provided using `ssh_private_key_file`, the key's\ncorresponding public key can be accessed using the above engine.\n\n- `ssh_private_key_file` (string) - Path to a PEM encoded private key file to use to authenticate with SSH.\n  The `~` can be used in path and will be expanded to the home directory\n  of current user.\n\n\nIf `ssh_password` and `ssh_private_key_file` are not specified, Packer will\nautomatically generate en ephemeral key pair. The key pair's public key can be\naccessed using the template engine.\n\nFor example, the public key can be provided in the boot command as a URL encoded\nstring by appending `| urlquery` to the variable:\n\nHCL Example:\n\n```hcl\nboot_command = [\n  \"<up><wait><tab> text ks=http://{{ .HTTPIP }}:{{ .HTTPPort }}/ks.cfg PACKER_USER={{ user `username` }} PACKER_AUTHORIZED_KEY={{ .SSHPublicKey | urlquery }}<enter>\"\n]\n```\n\nJSON Example\n\n```json\n\"boot_command\": [\n  \"<up><wait><tab> text ks=http://{{ .HTTPIP }}:{{ .HTTPPort }}/ks.cfg PACKER_USER={{ user `username` }} PACKER_AUTHORIZED_KEY={{ .SSHPublicKey | urlquery }}<enter>\"\n]\n```\n\nA kickstart can use those fields from the kernel command line by decoding the\nURL-encoded public key:\n\n```shell\n%post\n\n# Newly created users need the file/folder framework for SSH key authentication.\numask 0077\nmkdir /etc/skel/.ssh\ntouch /etc/skel/.ssh/authorized_keys\n\n# Loop over the command line.

The resultant virtual machine is fully\n  independant from the parent it was cloned from.\n  \n  Setting linked to true instead causes Packer to create the virtual\n  machine as a 'linked' clone. Linked clones use and require ongoing\n  access to the disks of the parent virtual machine. The benefit of a\n  linked clone is that the clones virtual disk is typically very much\n  smaller than would be the case for a full clone. Additionally, the\n  cloned virtual machine can also be created much faster. Creating a\n  linked clone will typically only be of benefit in some advanced build\n  scenarios. Most users will wish to create a full clone instead. Defaults\n  to false.\n\n- `attach_snapshot` (string) - Default to `null/empty`. The name of an\n  **existing** snapshot to which the builder shall attach the VM before\n  starting it. If no snapshot is specified the builder will simply start the\n  VM from it's current state i.e. snapshot.\n\n- `vm_name` (string) - This is the name of the VMX file for the new virtual\n  machine, without the file extension. By default this is packer-BUILDNAME,\n  where \"BUILDNAME\" is the name of the build.\n\n- `snapshot_name` (string) - This is the name of the initial snapshot created after provisioning and cleanup.\n  if left blank, no initial snapshot will be created\n\n<!-- End of code generated from the comments of the Config struct in builder/vmware/vmx/config.go; -->\n\n\n### Extra Disk Configuration\n\n**Optional**:\n\n<!-- Code generated from the comments of the DiskConfig struct in builder/vmware/common/disk_config.go; DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY -->\n\n- `disk_additional_size` ([]uint) - The size(s) of additional virtual hard disks in MB.

Directory\n  names are also allowed, which will add all the files found in the\n  directory to the floppy.\n\n- `floppy_dirs` ([]string) - A list of directories to place onto the floppy disk recursively. This is\n  similar to the `floppy_files` option except that the directory structure\n  is preserved. This is useful for when your floppy disk includes drivers\n  or if you just want to organize it's contents as a hierarchy. Wildcard\n  characters (\\\\*, ?, and \\[\\]) are allowed. The maximum summary size of\n  all files in the listed directories are the same as in `floppy_files`.\n\n- `floppy_content` (map[string]string) - Key/Values to add to the floppy disk. The keys represent the paths, and\n  the values contents. It can be used alongside `floppy_files` or\n  `floppy_dirs`, which is useful to add large files without loading them\n  into memory. If any paths are specified by both, the contents in\n  `floppy_content` will take precedence.\n  \n  Usage example (HCL):\n  \n  ```hcl\n  floppy_files = [\"vendor-data\"]\n  floppy_content = {\n    \"meta-data\" = jsonencode(local.instance_data)\n    \"user-data\" = templatefile(\"user-data\", { packages = [\"nginx\"] })\n  }\n  floppy_label = \"cidata\"\n  ```\n\n- `floppy_label` (string) - Floppy Label\n\n<!-- End of code generated from the comments of the FloppyConfig struct in multistep/commonsteps/floppy_config.go; -->\n\n\n### CD-ROM Configuration\n\n<!-- Code generated from the comments of the CDConfig struct in multistep/commonsteps/extra_iso_config.go; DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY -->\n\nAn iso (CD) containing custom files can be made available for your build.\n\nBy default, no extra CD will be attached. All files listed in this setting\nget placed into the root directory of the CD and the CD is attached as the\nsecond CD device.\n\nThis config exists to work around modern operating systems that have no\nway to mount floppy disks, which was our previous go-to for adding files at\nboot time.\n\n<!-- End of code generated from the comments of the CDConfig struct in multistep/commonsteps/extra_iso_config.go; -->\n\n\n**Optional**:\n\n<!-- Code generated from the comments of the CDConfig struct in multistep/commonsteps/extra_iso_config.go; DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY -->\n\n- `cd_files` ([]string) - A list of files to place onto a CD that is attached when the VM is\n  booted. This can include either files or directories; any directories\n  will be copied onto the CD recursively, preserving directory structure\n  hierarchy. Symlinks will have the link's target copied into the directory\n  tree on the CD where the symlink was. File globbing is allowed.\n  \n  Usage example (JSON):\n  \n  ```json\n  \"cd_files\": [\"./somedirectory/meta-data\", \"./somedirectory/user-data\"],\n  \"cd_label\": \"cidata\",\n  ```\n  \n  Usage example (HCL):\n  \n  ```hcl\n  cd_files = [\"./somedirectory/meta-data\", \"./somedirectory/user-data\"]\n  cd_label = \"cidata\"\n  ```\n  \n  The above will create a CD with two files, user-data and meta-data in the\n  CD root. This specific example is how you would create a CD that can be\n  used for an Ubuntu 20.04 autoinstall.\n  \n  Since globbing is also supported,\n  \n  ```hcl\n  cd_files = [\"./somedirectory/*\"]\n  cd_label = \"cidata\"\n  ```\n  \n  Would also be an acceptable way to define the above cd. The difference\n  between providing the directory with or without the glob is whether the\n  directory itself or its contents will be at the CD root.\n  \n  Use of this option assumes that you have a command line tool installed\n  that can handle the iso creation. Packer will use one of the following\n  tools:\n  \n    * xorriso\n    * mkisofs\n    * hdiutil (normally found in macOS)\n    * oscdimg (normally found in Windows as part of the Windows ADK)\n\n- `cd_content` (map[string]string) - Key/Values to add to the CD. The keys represent the paths, and the values\n  contents. It can be used alongside `cd_files`, which is useful to add large\n  files without loading them into memory. If any paths are specified by both,\n  the contents in `cd_content` will take precedence.\n  \n  Usage example (HCL):\n  \n  ```hcl\n  cd_files = [\"vendor-data\"]\n  cd_content = {\n    \"meta-data\" = jsonencode(local.instance_data)\n    \"user-data\" = templatefile(\"user-data\", { packages = [\"nginx\"] })\n  }\n  cd_label = \"cidata\"\n  ```\n\n- `cd_label` (string) - CD Label\n\n<!-- End of code generated from the comments of the CDConfig struct in multistep/commonsteps/extra_iso_config.go; -->\n\n\n### HTTP Configuration\n\n<!-- Code generated from the comments of the HTTPConfig struct in multistep/commonsteps/http_config.go; DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY -->\n\nPacker will create an http server serving `http_directory` when it is set, a\nrandom free port will be selected and the architecture of the directory\nreferenced will be available in your builder.\n\nExample usage from a builder:\n\n```\nwget http://{{ .HTTPIP }}:{{ .HTTPPort }}/foo/bar/preseed.cfg\n```\n\n<!-- End of code generated from the comments of the HTTPConfig struct in multistep/commonsteps/http_config.go; -->\n\n\n**Optional**:\n\n<!-- Code generated from the comments of the HTTPConfig struct in multistep/commonsteps/http_config.go; DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY -->\n\n- `http_directory` (string) - Path to a directory to serve using an HTTP server. The files in this\n  directory will be available over HTTP that will be requestable from the\n  virtual machine. This is useful for hosting kickstart files and so on.\n  By default this is an empty string, which means no HTTP server will be\n  started. The address and port of the HTTP server will be available as\n  variables in `boot_command`. This is covered in more detail below.\n\n- `http_content` (map[string]string) - Key/Values to serve using an HTTP server. `http_content` works like and\n  conflicts with `http_directory`. The keys represent the paths and the\n  values contents, the keys must start with a slash, ex: `/path/to/file`.\n  `http_content` is useful for hosting kickstart files and so on. By\n  default this is empty, which means no HTTP server will be started. The\n  address and port of the HTTP server will be available as variables in\n  `boot_command`. This is covered in more detail below.\n  Example:\n  ```hcl\n    http_content = {\n      \"/a/b\"     = file(\"http/b\")\n      \"/foo/bar\" = templatefile(\"${path.root}/preseed.cfg\", { packages = [\"nginx\"] })\n    }\n  ```\n\n- `http_port_min` (int) - These are the minimum and maximum port to use for the HTTP server\n  started to serve the `http_directory`. Because Packer often runs in\n  parallel, Packer will choose a randomly available port in this range to\n  run the HTTP server. If you want to force the HTTP server to be on one\n  port, make this minimum and maximum port the same. By default the values\n  are `8000` and `9000`, respectively.\n\n- `http_port_max` (int) - HTTP Port Max\n\n- `http_bind_address` (string) - This is the bind address for the HTTP server. Defaults to 0.0.0.0 so that\n  it will work with any network interface.\n\n<!-- End of code generated from the comments of the HTTPConfig struct in multistep/commonsteps/http_config.go; -->\n\n\n## Shutdown Configuration\n\n**Optional**:\n\n<!-- Code generated from the comments of the ShutdownConfig struct in shutdowncommand/config.go; DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY -->\n\n- `shutdown_command` (string) - The command to use to gracefully shut down the machine once all\n  provisioning is complete. By default this is an empty string, which\n  tells Packer to just forcefully shut down the machine. This setting can\n  be safely omitted if for example, a shutdown command to gracefully halt\n  the machine is configured inside a provisioning script. If one or more\n  scripts require a reboot it is suggested to leave this blank (since\n  reboots may fail) and instead specify the final shutdown command in your\n  last script.\n\n- `shutdown_timeout` (duration string | ex: \"1h5m2s\") - The amount of time to wait after executing the shutdown_command for the\n  virtual machine to actually shut down. If the machine doesn't shut down\n  in this time it is considered an error. By default, the time out is \"5m\"\n  (five minutes).\n\n<!-- End of code generated from the comments of the ShutdownConfig struct in shutdowncommand/config.go; -->\n\n\n### Export Configuration\n\n**Optional**:\n\n<!-- Code generated from the comments of the ExportConfig struct in builder/vmware/common/export_config.go; DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY -->\n\n- `format` (string) - The output format of the exported virtual machine. Allowed values are\n  `ova`, `ovf`, or `vmx`. Defaults to `vmx` for local desktop hypervisors\n  and `ova` for remote hypervisors.\n  \n  For builds on a remote hypervisor, `remote_password` must be set when\n  exporting the virtual machine\n  \n  For builds on a local desktop hypervisor, the plugin will create a `.vmx`\n  and export the virtual machine as an `.ovf` or `.ova` file. THe plugin\n  will not delete the `.vmx` and `.vmdk` files. You must manually delete\n  these files if they are no longer needed.\n  \n  ~> **Note:** Ensure VMware OVF Tool is installed. For the latest version,\n  visit [VMware OVF Tool](https://developer.broadcom.com/tools/open-virtualization-format-ovf-tool/latest).\n  \n  ~> **Note:** For local builds, the plugin will create a `.vmx` and\n  supporting files in the output directory and will then export the\n  virtual machine to the specified format. These files are **not**\n  automatically cleaned up after the export process.\n\n- `ovftool_options` ([]string) - Additional command-line arguments to send to VMware OVF Tool during the\n  export process. Each string in the array represents a separate\n  command-line argument.\n  \n  ~> **Important:** The options `--noSSLVerify`, `--skipManifestCheck`, and\n  `--targetType` are automatically applied by the plugin for remote exports\n  and should not be included in the options. For local OVF/OVA exports,\n  the plugin does not preset any VMware OVF Tool options by default.\n  \n  ~> **Note:** Ensure VMware OVF Tool is installed. For the latest version,\n  visit [VMware OVF Tool](https://developer.broadcom.com/tools/open-virtualization-format-ovf-tool/latest).\n\n- `skip_export` (bool) - Skips the export of the virtual machine. This is useful if the build\n  output is not the resultant image, but created inside the virtual\n  machine. This is useful for debugging purposes. Defaults to `false`.\n\n- `keep_registered` (bool) - Determines whether a virtual machine built on a remote hypervisor should\n  remain registered after the build process. Setting this to `true` can be\n  useful if the virtual machine does not need to be exported. Defaults to\n  `false`.\n\n- `skip_compaction` (bool) - At the end of the build process, the plugin defragments and compacts the\n  disks using `vmware-vdiskmanager` or `vmkfstools` for ESXi environments.\n  In some cases, this process may result in slightly larger disk sizes.\n  If this occurs, you can opt to skip the disk compaction step by using\n  this setting. Defaults to `false`. Defaults to `true` for ESXi when\n  `disk_type_id` is not explicitly defined and `false`\n\n<!-- End of code generated from the comments of the ExportConfig struct in builder/vmware/common/export_config.go; -->\n\n\n### Output Configuration\n\n**Optional**:\n\n<!-- Code generated from the comments of the OutputConfig struct in builder/vmware/common/output_config.go; DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY -->\n\n- `output_directory` (string) - This is the path on your local machine (the one running Packer) to the\n  directory where the resulting virtual machine will be created.\n  This may be relative or absolute. If relative, the path is relative to\n  the working directory when packer is executed.\n  \n  If you are running a remote hypervisor build, the output_dir is the path on your\n  local machine (the machine running Packer) to which Packer will export\n  the vm if you have `\"skip_export\": false`. If you want to manage the\n  virtual machine's path on the remote datastore, use `remote_output_dir`.\n  \n  This directory must not exist or be empty prior to running\n  the builder.\n  \n  By default this is output-BUILDNAME where \"BUILDNAME\" is the name of the\n  build.\n\n- `remote_output_directory` (string) - This is the directory on your remote hypervisor where you will save your\n  vm, relative to your remote_datastore.\n  \n  This option's default value is your `vm_name`, and the final path of your\n  vm will be vmfs/volumes/$remote_datastore/$vm_name/$vm_name.vmx where\n  `$remote_datastore` and `$vm_name` match their corresponding template\n  options\n  \n  For example, setting `\"remote_output_directory\": \"path/to/subdir`\n  will create a directory `/vmfs/volumes/remote_datastore/path/to/subdir`.\n  \n  Packer will not create the remote datastore for you; it must already\n  exist. However, Packer will create all directories defined in the option\n  that do not currently exist.\n  \n  This option will be ignored unless you are building on a remote hypervisor.\n\n<!-- End of code generated from the comments of the OutputConfig struct in builder/vmware/common/output_config.go; -->\n\n\n### Hypervisor Configuration\n\n**Optional**:\n\n<!-- Code generated from the comments of the DriverConfig struct in builder/vmware/common/driver_config.go; DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY -->\n\n- `fusion_app_path` (string) - Path to \"VMware Fusion.app\". By default this is\n  /Applications/VMware Fusion.app but this setting allows you to\n  customize this.\n\n- `remote_type` (string) - The type of remote machine that will be used to\n  build this VM rather than a local desktop product. The only value accepted\n  for this currently is esx5. If this is not set, a desktop product will\n  be used. By default, this is not set.\n\n- `remote_datastore` (string) - The path to the datastore where the VM will be stored\n  on the ESXi machine.\n\n- `remote_cache_datastore` (string) - The path to the datastore where supporting files\n  will be stored during the build on the remote machine.\n\n- `remote_cache_directory` (string) - The path where the ISO and/or floppy files will\n  be stored during the build on the remote machine. The path is relative to\n  the remote_cache_datastore on the remote machine.\n\n- `cleanup_remote_cache` (bool) - When set to true, Packer will cleanup the cache folder where the ISO file is stored during the build on the remote machine.\n  By default, this is set to false.\n\n- `remote_host` (string) - The host of the remote machine used for access.\n  This is only required if remote_type is enabled.\n\n- `remote_port` (int) - The SSH port of the remote machine\n\n- `remote_username` (string) - The SSH username used to access the remote machine.\n\n- `remote_password` (string) - The SSH password for access to the remote machine.\n\n- `remote_private_key_file` (string) - The SSH key for access to the remote machine.\n\n- `skip_validate_credentials` (bool) - When Packer is preparing to run a\n  remote hypervisor build, and export is not disable, by default it runs a no-op\n  ovftool command to make sure that the remote_username and remote_password\n  given are valid. If you set this flag to true, Packer will skip this\n  validation. Default: false.\n\n<!-- End of code generated from the comments of the DriverConfig struct in builder/vmware/common/driver_config.go; -->\n\n\n### Advanced Configuration\n\n**Optional**:\n\n<!-- Code generated from the comments of the VMXConfig struct in builder/vmware/common/vmx_config.go; DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY -->\n\n- `vmx_data` (map[string]string) - Key-value pairs that will be inserted into the virtual machine `.vmx`\n  file **before** the virtual machine is started. This is useful for\n  setting advanced properties that are not supported by the plugin.\n  \n  ~> **Note**: This option is intended for advanced users who understand\n  the ramifications of making changes to the `.vmx` file. This option is\n  not necessary for most users.\n\n- `vmx_data_post` (map[string]string) - Key-value pairs that will be inserted into the virtual machine `.vmx`\n  file **after** the virtual machine is started. This is useful for setting\n  advanced properties that are not supported by the plugin.\n  \n  ~> **Note**: This option is intended for advanced users who understand\n  the ramifications of making changes to the `.vmx` file. This option is\n  not necessary for most users.\n\n- `vmx_remove_ethernet_interfaces` (bool) - Remove all network adapters from virtual machine `.vmx` file after the\n  virtual machine build is complete. Defaults to `false`.\n  \n  ~> **Note**: This option is useful when building Vagrant boxes since\n  Vagrant will create interfaces when provisioning a box.\n\n- `display_name` (string) - The inventory display name for the virtual machine. If set, the value\n  provided will override any value set in the `vmx_data` option or in the\n  `.vmx` file. This option is useful if you are chaining builds and want to\n  ensure that the display name of each step in the chain is unique.\n\n<!-- End of code generated from the comments of the VMXConfig struct in builder/vmware/common/vmx_config.go; -->\n\n\n## Boot Configuration\n\n<!-- Code generated from the comments of the BootConfig struct in bootcommand/config.go; DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY -->\n\nThe boot configuration is very important: `boot_command` specifies the keys\nto type when the virtual machine is first booted in order to start the OS\ninstaller. This command is typed after boot_wait, which gives the virtual\nmachine some time to actually load.\n\nThe boot_command is an array of strings. The strings are all typed in\nsequence. It is an array only to improve readability within the template.\n\nThere are a set of special keys available. If these are in your boot\ncommand, they will be replaced by the proper key:\n\n-   `<bs>` - Backspace\n\n-   `<del>` - Delete\n\n-   `<enter> <return>` - Simulates an actual \"enter\" or \"return\" keypress.\n\n-   `<esc>` - Simulates pressing the escape key.\n\n-   `<tab>` - Simulates pressing the tab key.\n\n-   `<f1> - <f12>` - Simulates pressing a function key.\n\n-   `<up> <down> <left> <right>` - Simulates pressing an arrow key.\n\n-   `<spacebar>` - Simulates pressing the spacebar.\n\n-   `<insert>` - Simulates pressing the insert key.\n\n-   `<home> <end>` - Simulates pressing the home and end keys.\n\n  - `<pageUp> <pageDown>` - Simulates pressing the page up and page down\n    keys.\n\n-   `<menu>` - Simulates pressing the Menu key.\n\n-   `<leftAlt> <rightAlt>` - Simulates pressing the alt key.\n\n-   `<leftCtrl> <rightCtrl>` - Simulates pressing the ctrl key.\n\n-   `<leftShift> <rightShift>` - Simulates pressing the shift key.\n\n-   `<leftSuper> <rightSuper>` - Simulates pressing the ⌘ or Windows key.\n\n  - `<wait> <wait5> <wait10>` - Adds a 1, 5 or 10 second pause before\n    sending any additional keys. This is useful if you have to generally\n    wait for the UI to update before typing more.\n\n  - `<waitXX>` - Add an arbitrary pause before sending any additional keys.\n    The format of `XX` is a sequence of positive decimal numbers, each with\n    optional fraction and a unit suffix, such as `300ms`, `1.5h` or `2h45m`.\n    Valid time units are `ns`, `us` (or `µs`), `ms`, `s`, `m`, `h`. For\n    example `<wait10m>` or `<wait1m20s>`.\n\n  - `<XXXOn> <XXXOff>` - Any printable keyboard character, and of these\n    \"special\" expressions, with the exception of the `<wait>` types, can\n    also be toggled on or off. For example, to simulate ctrl+c, use\n    `<leftCtrlOn>c<leftCtrlOff>`. Be sure to release them, otherwise they\n    will be held down until the machine reboots. To hold the `c` key down,\n    you would use `<cOn>`. Likewise, `<cOff>` to release.\n\n  - `{{ .HTTPIP }} {{ .HTTPPort }}` - The IP and port, respectively of an\n    HTTP server that is started serving the directory specified by the\n    `http_directory` configuration parameter. If `http_directory` isn't\n    specified, these will be blank!\n\n-   `{{ .Name }}` - The name of the VM.\n\nExample boot command. This is actually a working boot command used to start an\nCentOS 6.4 installer:\n\nIn JSON:\n\n```json\n\"boot_command\": [\n\n\t   \"<tab><wait>\",\n\t   \" ks=http://{{ .HTTPIP }}:{{ .HTTPPort }}/centos6-ks.cfg<enter>\"\n\t]\n\n```\n\nIn HCL2:\n\n```hcl\nboot_command = [\n\n\t   \"<tab><wait>\",\n\t   \" ks=http://{{ .HTTPIP }}:{{ .HTTPPort }}/centos6-ks.cfg<enter>\"\n\t]\n\n```\n\nThe example shown below is a working boot command used to start an Ubuntu\n12.04 installer:\n\nIn JSON:\n\n```json\n\"boot_command\": [\n\n\t\"<esc><esc><enter><wait>\",\n\t\"/install/vmlinuz noapic \",\n\t\"preseed/url=http://{{ .HTTPIP }}:{{ .HTTPPort }}/preseed.cfg \",\n\t\"debian-installer=en_US auto locale=en_US kbd-chooser/method=us \",\n\t\"hostname={{ .Name }} \",\n\t\"fb=false debconf/frontend=noninteractive \",\n\t\"keyboard-configuration/modelcode=SKIP keyboard-configuration/layout=USA \",\n\t\"keyboard-configuration/variant=USA console-setup/ask_detect=false \",\n\t\"initrd=/install/initrd.gz -- <enter>\"\n\n]\n```\n\nIn HCL2:\n\n```hcl\nboot_command = [\n\n\t\"<esc><esc><enter><wait>\",\n\t\"/install/vmlinuz noapic \",\n\t\"preseed/url=http://{{ .HTTPIP }}:{{ .HTTPPort }}/preseed.cfg \",\n\t\"debian-installer=en_US auto locale=en_US kbd-chooser/method=us \",\n\t\"hostname={{ .Name }} \",\n\t\"fb=false debconf/frontend=noninteractive \",\n\t\"keyboard-configuration/modelcode=SKIP keyboard-configuration/layout=USA \",\n\t\"keyboard-configuration/variant=USA console-setup/ask_detect=false \",\n\t\"initrd=/install/initrd.gz -- <enter>\"\n\n]\n```\n\nFor more examples of various boot commands, see the sample projects from our\n[community templates page](https://packer.io/community-tools#templates).\n\n<!-- End of code generated from the comments of the BootConfig struct in bootcommand/config.go; -->\n\n\n<!-- Code generated from the comments of the VNCConfig struct in bootcommand/config.go; DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY -->\n\nThe boot command \"typed\" character for character over a VNC connection to\nthe machine, simulating a human actually typing the keyboard.\n\nKeystrokes are typed as separate key up/down events over VNC with a default\n100ms delay. The delay alleviates issues with latency and CPU contention.\nYou can tune this delay on a per-builder basis by specifying\n\"boot_key_interval\" in your Packer template.\n\n<!-- End of code generated from the comments of the VNCConfig struct in bootcommand/config.go; -->\n\n\n-> **Note**: For the `HTTPIP` to be resolved, the `network` interface type must\nbe set to either `hostonly` or `nat`. It is recommended to leave the default\nnetwork configuration while you are building the virtual machine, and use the\n`vmx_data_post` hook to modify the network configuration after the virtual\nmachine build is complete.\n\n**Optional**\n\n<!-- Code generated from the comments of the BootConfig struct in bootcommand/config.go; DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY -->\n\n- `boot_keygroup_interval` (duration string | ex: \"1h5m2s\") - Time to wait after sending a group of key pressses. The value of this\n  should be a duration. Examples are `5s` and `1m30s` which will cause\n  Packer to wait five seconds and one minute 30 seconds, respectively. If\n  this isn't specified, a sensible default value is picked depending on\n  the builder type.\n\n- `boot_wait` (duration string | ex: \"1h5m2s\") - The time to wait after booting the initial virtual machine before typing\n  the `boot_command`. The value of this should be a duration. Examples are\n  `5s` and `1m30s` which will cause Packer to wait five seconds and one\n  minute 30 seconds, respectively. If this isn't specified, the default is\n  `10s` or 10 seconds. To set boot_wait to 0s, use a negative number, such\n  as \"-1s\"\n\n- `boot_command` ([]string) - This is an array of commands to type when the virtual machine is first\n  booted. The goal of these commands should be to type just enough to\n  initialize the operating system installer. Special keys can be typed as\n  well, and are covered in the section below on the boot command. If this\n  is not specified, it is assumed the installer will start itself.\n\n<!-- End of code generated from the comments of the BootConfig struct in bootcommand/config.go; -->\n\n\n<!-- Code generated from the comments of the VNCConfig struct in bootcommand/config.go; DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY -->\n\n- `disable_vnc` (bool) - Whether to create a VNC connection or not. A boot_command cannot be used\n  when this is true. Defaults to false.\n\n- `boot_key_interval` (duration string | ex: \"1h5m2s\") - Time in ms to wait between each key press\n\n<!-- End of code generated from the comments of the VNCConfig struct in bootcommand/config.go; -->\n\n\n<!-- Code generated from the comments of the RunConfig struct in builder/vmware/common/run_config.go; DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY -->\n\n- `headless` (bool) - The plugin defaults to building virtual machines by launching the\n  desktop hypervisor's graphical user interface (GUI) to display the\n  console of the virtual machine being built. When this value is set to\n  `true`, the virtual machine will start without a console; however, the\n  plugin will output VNC connection information in case you need to connect\n  to the console to debug the build process. Defaults to `false`.\n  \n  ~> **Note:** Some users have experienced issues where Packer cannot\n  properly connect to a virtual machine when using `headless`. This is\n  often attributed to the use of an evaluation license for VMware desktop\n  hypervisors. It is recommended to launch the product and accept the\n  evaluation license to resolve this if you encounter an issue with this\n  option.\n\n- `vnc_bind_address` (string) - The IP address to use for VNC access to the virtual machine. Defaults to\n  `127.0.0.1`.\n  \n  ~> **Note:** To bind to all interfaces use `0.0.0.0`.\n\n- `vnc_port_min` (int) - The minimum port number to use for VNC access to the virtual machine.\n  The plugin uses VNC to type the `boot_command`. Defaults to `5900`.\n\n- `vnc_port_max` (int) - The maximum port number to use for VNC access to the virtual machine.\n  The plugin uses VNC to type the `boot_command`. Defaults to `6000`.\n  \n  ~> **Note:** The plugin randomly selects port within the inclusive range\n  specified by `vnc_port_min` and `vnc_port_max`.\n\n- `vnc_disable_password` (bool) - Disables the auto-generation of a VNC password that is used to secure the\n  VNC communication with the virtual machine. Defaults to `false`.\n  \n  ~> **Important:** Must be set to `true` for remote hypervisor builds with\n  VNC enabled.\n\n- `vnc_over_websocket` (bool) - Connect to VNC over a websocket connection. Defaults to `false`.\n  \n  ~> **Note:** When set to `true`, any other VNC configuration options will\n  be ignored.\n  \n  ~> **Important:** Must be set to `true` for remote hypervisor builds with\n  VNC enabled.\n\n- `insecure_connection` (bool) - Do not validate TLS certificate when connecting to VNC over a websocket\n  connection. Defaults to `false`.\n\n<!-- End of code generated from the comments of the RunConfig struct in builder/vmware/common/run_config.go; -->\n\n\n~> **Note**: Packer dynamically selects a VNC port for remote builds by scanning a range from\n`vnc_port_min` to `vnc_port_max`. It looks for an available port by checking if\nanything is listening on each port within this range. In environments with\nmultiple clients building on the same ESXi host, there might be competition for\nVNC ports. To manage this, you can adjust the connection timeout with the\n`PACKER_ESXI_VNC_PROBE_TIMEOUT` environment variable. This variable sets the\ntimeout in seconds for each VNC port probe attempt to determine if the port is\navailable. The default is 15 seconds. Decrease this timeout if VNC connections\nare frequently refused, or increase it if Packer struggles to find an open port.\nThis setting is an advanced configuration option and should be used with caution.\nEnsure your firewall settings are appropriately configured before making\nadjustments.\n\n\n### Communicator Configuration\n\n**Optional**:\n\n##### Common\n\n<!-- Code generated from the comments of the Config struct in communicator/config.go; DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY -->\n\n- `communicator` (string) - Packer currently supports three kinds of communicators:\n  \n  -   `none` - No communicator will be used. If this is set, most\n      provisioners also can't be used.\n  \n  -   `ssh` - An SSH connection will be established to the machine. This\n      is usually the default.\n  \n  -   `winrm` - A WinRM connection will be established.\n  \n  In addition to the above, some builders have custom communicators they\n  can use. For example, the Docker builder has a \"docker\" communicator\n  that uses `docker exec` and `docker cp` to execute scripts and copy\n  files.\n\n- `pause_before_connecting` (duration string | ex: \"1h5m2s\") - We recommend that you enable SSH or WinRM as the very last step in your\n  guest's bootstrap script, but sometimes you may have a race condition\n  where you need Packer to wait before attempting to connect to your\n  guest.\n  \n  If you end up in this situation, you can use the template option\n  `pause_before_connecting`. By default, there is no pause. For example if\n  you set `pause_before_connecting` to `10m` Packer will check whether it\n  can connect, as normal. But once a connection attempt is successful, it\n  will disconnect and then wait 10 minutes before connecting to the guest\n  and beginning provisioning.\n\n<!-- End of code generated from the comments of the Config struct in communicator/config.go; -->\n\n\n##### SSH\n\n<!-- Code generated from the comments of the SSH struct in communicator/config.go; DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY -->\n\n- `ssh_host` (string) - The address to SSH to. This usually is automatically configured by the\n  builder.\n\n- `ssh_port` (int) - The port to connect to SSH. This defaults to `22`.\n\n- `ssh_username` (string) - The username to connect to SSH with. Required if using SSH.\n\n- `ssh_password` (string) - A plaintext password to use to authenticate with SSH.\n\n- `ssh_ciphers` ([]string) - This overrides the value of ciphers supported by default by Golang.\n  The default value is [\n    \"aes128-gcm@openssh.com\",\n    \"chacha20-poly1305@openssh.com\",\n    \"aes128-ctr\", \"aes192-ctr\", \"aes256-ctr\",\n  ]\n  \n  Valid options for ciphers include:\n  \"aes128-ctr\", \"aes192-ctr\", \"aes256-ctr\", \"aes128-gcm@openssh.com\",\n  \"chacha20-poly1305@openssh.com\",\n  \"arcfour256\", \"arcfour128\", \"arcfour\", \"aes128-cbc\", \"3des-cbc\",\n\n- `ssh_clear_authorized_keys` (bool) - If true, Packer will attempt to remove its temporary key from\n  `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` and `/root/.ssh/authorized_keys`. This is a\n  mostly cosmetic option, since Packer will delete the temporary private\n  key from the host system regardless of whether this is set to true\n  (unless the user has set the `-debug` flag). Defaults to \"false\";\n  currently only works on guests with `sed` installed.\n\n- `ssh_key_exchange_algorithms` ([]string) - If set, Packer will override the value of key exchange (kex) algorithms\n  supported by default by Golang. Acceptable values include:\n  \"curve25519-sha256@libssh.org\", \"ecdh-sha2-nistp256\",\n  \"ecdh-sha2-nistp384\", \"ecdh-sha2-nistp521\",\n  \"diffie-hellman-group14-sha1\", and \"diffie-hellman-group1-sha1\".\n\n- `ssh_certificate_file` (string) - Path to user certificate used to authenticate with SSH.\n  The `~` can be used in path and will be expanded to the\n  home directory of current user.\n\n- `ssh_pty` (bool) - If `true`, a PTY will be requested for the SSH connection. This defaults\n  to `false`.\n\n- `ssh_timeout` (duration string | ex: \"1h5m2s\") - The time to wait for SSH to become available. Packer uses this to\n  determine when the machine has booted so this is usually quite long.\n  Example value: `10m`.\n  This defaults to `5m`, unless `ssh_handshake_attempts` is set.\n\n- `ssh_disable_agent_forwarding` (bool) - If true, SSH agent forwarding will be disabled. Defaults to `false`.\n\n- `ssh_handshake_attempts` (int) - The number of handshakes to attempt with SSH once it can connect.\n  This defaults to `10`, unless a `ssh_timeout` is set.\n\n- `ssh_bastion_host` (string) - A bastion host to use for the actual SSH connection.\n\n- `ssh_bastion_port` (int) - The port of the bastion host. Defaults to `22`.\n\n- `ssh_bastion_agent_auth` (bool) - If `true`, the local SSH agent will be used to authenticate with the\n  bastion host. Defaults to `false`.\n\n- `ssh_bastion_username` (string) - The username to connect to the bastion host.\n\n- `ssh_bastion_password` (string) - The password to use to authenticate with the bastion host.\n\n- `ssh_bastion_interactive` (bool) - If `true`, the keyboard-interactive used to authenticate with bastion host.\n\n- `ssh_bastion_private_key_file` (string) - Path to a PEM encoded private key file to use to authenticate with the\n  bastion host. The `~` can be used in path and will be expanded to the\n  home directory of current user.\n\n- `ssh_bastion_certificate_file` (string) - Path to user certificate used to authenticate with bastion host.\n  The `~` can be used in path and will be expanded to the\n  home directory of current user.\n\n- `ssh_file_transfer_method` (string) - `scp` or `sftp` - How to transfer files, Secure copy (default) or SSH\n  File Transfer Protocol.\n  \n  **NOTE**: Guests using Windows with Win32-OpenSSH v9.1.0.0p1-Beta, scp\n  (the default protocol for copying data) returns a a non-zero error code since the MOTW\n  cannot be set, which cause any file transfer to fail. As a workaround you can override the transfer protocol\n  with SFTP instead `ssh_file_transfer_method = \"sftp\"`.\n\n- `ssh_proxy_host` (string) - A SOCKS proxy host to use for SSH connection\n\n- `ssh_proxy_port` (int) - A port of the SOCKS proxy. Defaults to `1080`.\n\n- `ssh_proxy_username` (string) - The optional username to authenticate with the proxy server.\n\n- `ssh_proxy_password` (string) - The optional password to use to authenticate with the proxy server.\n\n- `ssh_keep_alive_interval` (duration string | ex: \"1h5m2s\") - How often to send \"keep alive\" messages to the server. Set to a negative\n  value (`-1s`) to disable. Example value: `10s`. Defaults to `5s`.\n\n- `ssh_read_write_timeout` (duration string | ex: \"1h5m2s\") - The amount of time to wait for a remote command to end. This might be\n  useful if, for example, packer hangs on a connection after a reboot.\n  Example: `5m`. Disabled by default.\n\n- `ssh_remote_tunnels` ([]string) - \n\n- `ssh_local_tunnels` ([]string) - \n\n<!-- End of code generated from the comments of the SSH struct in communicator/config.go; -->\n\n\n<!-- Code generated from the comments of the SSHTemporaryKeyPair struct in communicator/config.go; DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY -->\n\n- `temporary_key_pair_type` (string) - `dsa` | `ecdsa` | `ed25519` | `rsa` ( the default )\n  \n  Specifies the type of key to create. The possible values are 'dsa',\n  'ecdsa', 'ed25519', or 'rsa'.\n  \n  NOTE: DSA is deprecated and no longer recognized as secure, please\n  consider other alternatives like RSA or ED25519.\n\n- `temporary_key_pair_bits` (int) - Specifies the number of bits in the key to create. For RSA keys, the\n  minimum size is 1024 bits and the default is 4096 bits. Generally, 3072\n  bits is considered sufficient. DSA keys must be exactly 1024 bits as\n  specified by FIPS 186-2. For ECDSA keys, bits determines the key length\n  by selecting from one of three elliptic curve sizes: 256, 384 or 521\n  bits. Attempting to use bit lengths other than these three values for\n  ECDSA keys will fail. Ed25519 keys have a fixed length and bits will be\n  ignored.\n  \n  NOTE: DSA is deprecated and no longer recognized as secure as specified\n  by FIPS 186-5, please consider other alternatives like RSA or ED25519.\n\n<!-- End of code generated from the comments of the SSHTemporaryKeyPair struct in communicator/config.go; -->\n\n\n##### Windows Remote Management (WinRM)\n\n<!-- Code generated from the comments of the WinRM struct in communicator/config.go; DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY -->\n\n- `winrm_username` (string) - The username to use to connect to WinRM.\n\n- `winrm_password` (string) - The password to use to connect to WinRM.\n\n- `winrm_host` (string) - The address for WinRM to connect to.\n  \n  NOTE: If using an Amazon EBS builder, you can specify the interface\n  WinRM connects to via\n  [`ssh_interface`](/packer/integrations/hashicorp/amazon/latest/components/builder/ebs#ssh_interface)\n\n- `winrm_no_proxy` (bool) - Setting this to `true` adds the remote\n  `host:port` to the `NO_PROXY` environment variable. This has the effect of\n  bypassing any configured proxies when connecting to the remote host.\n  Default to `false`.\n\n- `winrm_port` (int) - The WinRM port to connect to. This defaults to `5985` for plain\n  unencrypted connection and `5986` for SSL when `winrm_use_ssl` is set to\n  true.\n\n- `winrm_timeout` (duration string | ex: \"1h5m2s\") - The amount of time to wait for WinRM to become available. This defaults\n  to `30m` since setting up a Windows machine generally takes a long time.\n\n- `winrm_use_ssl` (bool) - If `true`, use HTTPS for WinRM.\n\n- `winrm_insecure` (bool) - If `true`, do not check server certificate chain and host name.\n\n- `winrm_use_ntlm` (bool) - If `true`, NTLMv2 authentication (with session security) will be used\n  for WinRM, rather than default (basic authentication), removing the\n  requirement for basic authentication to be enabled within the target\n  guest. Further reading for remote connection authentication can be found\n  [here](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa384295(v=vs.85).aspx).\n\n<!-- End of code generated from the comments of the WinRM struct in communicator/config.go; -->\n\n\n## Building on VMware vSphere Hypervisor\n\nIn addition to using the desktop virtualization products to build virtual\nmachines, this plugin can use a VMware vSphere Hypervisor to build the virtual\nmachine.\n\nBefore using a vSphere Hypervisor, you need to enable `GuestIPHack` by\nrunning the following command:\n\n```shell-session\n$ esxcli system settings advanced set -o /Net/GuestIPHack -i 1\n```\n\nWhen using the vSphere Hypervisor, the builder still downloads the ISO and\nvarious files locally, and uploads these to the remote hypervisore. This plugin\nuses SSH to communicate to the ESXi host rather than the vSphere API. [^2]\n\nThis plugin also requires VNC to issue boot commands during a build. Please\nrefer to the VMware vSphere documentation on how to update the hypervisor's\nfirewall to allow these connections. VNC can be disabled by not setting a\n`boot_command` and setting `disable_vnc` to `true`.\n\nPlease note that you should disable vMotion for the host you intend to run\nbuilds on; a vMotion event will cause the build to fail.\n\nTo run a remote build for your virtual machine image, use the following\nconfigurations:\n\n**Required**:\n\n- [`remote_type`](#hypervisor-configuration)\n- [`remote_host`](#hypervisor-configuration)\n\n**Optional**:\n\n- [`remote_port`](#hypervisor-configuration)\n- [`remote_datastore`](#hypervisor-configuration)\n- [`remote_cache_datastore`](#hypervisor-configuration)\n- [`remote_cache_directory`](#hypervisor-configuration)\n- [`remote_username`](#hypervisor-configuration)\n- [`remote_password`](#hypervisor-configuration)\n- [`remote_private_key_file`](#hypervisor-configuration)\n- [`format`](#export-configuration)\n- [`vnc_disable_password`](#advanced-configuration)\n\n\n### SSH Key Pair Automation\n\nThe builders can inject the current SSH key pair's public key into the template\nusing the `SSHPublicKey` template engine. This is the SSH public key as a line\nin OpenSSH `authorized_keys` format.\n\nWhen a private key is provided using `ssh_private_key_file`, the key's\ncorresponding public key can be accessed using the above engine.\n\n- `ssh_private_key_file` (string) - Path to a PEM encoded private key file to use to authenticate with SSH.\n  The `~` can be used in path and will be expanded to the home directory\n  of current user.\n\n\nIf `ssh_password` and `ssh_private_key_file` are not specified, Packer will\nautomatically generate en ephemeral key pair. The key pair's public key can be\naccessed using the template engine.\n\nFor example, the public key can be provided in the boot command as a URL encoded\nstring by appending `| urlquery` to the variable:\n\nHCL Example:\n\n```hcl\nboot_command = [\n  \"<up><wait><tab> text ks=http://{{ .HTTPIP }}:{{ .HTTPPort }}/ks.cfg PACKER_USER={{ user `username` }} PACKER_AUTHORIZED_KEY={{ .SSHPublicKey | urlquery }}<enter>\"\n]\n```\n\nJSON Example\n\n```json\n\"boot_command\": [\n  \"<up><wait><tab> text ks=http://{{ .HTTPIP }}:{{ .HTTPPort }}/ks.cfg PACKER_USER={{ user `username` }} PACKER_AUTHORIZED_KEY={{ .SSHPublicKey | urlquery }}<enter>\"\n]\n```\n\nA kickstart can use those fields from the kernel command line by decoding the\nURL-encoded public key:\n\n```shell\n%post\n\n# Newly created users need the file/folder framework for SSH key authentication.\numask 0077\nmkdir /etc/skel/.ssh\ntouch /etc/skel/.ssh/authorized_keys\n\n# Loop over the command line. Set interesting variables.\nfor x in $(cat /proc/cmdline)\ndo\n  case $x in\n    PACKER_USER=*)\n      PACKER_USER=\"${x#*=}\"\n      ;;\n    PACKER_AUTHORIZED_KEY=*)\n      # URL decode $encoded into $PACKER_AUTHORIZED_KEY\n      encoded=$(echo \"${x#*=}\" | tr '+' ' ')\n      printf -v PACKER_AUTHORIZED_KEY '%b' \"${encoded//%/\\\\x}\"\n      ;;\n  esac\ndone\n\n# Create/configure packer user, if any.\nif [ -n \"$PACKER_USER\" ]\nthen\n  useradd $PACKER_USER\n  echo \"%$PACKER_USER ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL\" >> /etc/sudoers.d/$PACKER_USER\n  [ -n \"$PACKER_AUTHORIZED_KEY\" ] && echo $PACKER_AUTHORIZED_KEY >> $(eval echo ~\"$PACKER_USER\")/.ssh/authorized_keys\nfi\n\n%end\n```\n\n\n\n[^1]: Support for VMware Workstation Player is deprecated and will be removed in a future
