The result of the Qemu builder is a directory containing the image file\nnecessary to run the virtual machine on KVM.\n\n## Basic Example\n\nHere is a basic example. This example is functional so long as you fixup paths\nto files, URLS for ISOs and checksums.\n\n**HCL2**\n\n```hcl\nsource \"qemu\" \"example\" {\n  iso_url           = \"http://mirror.raystedman.net/centos/6/isos/x86_64/CentOS-6.9-x86_64-minimal.iso\"\n  iso_checksum      = \"md5:af4a1640c0c6f348c6c41f1ea9e192a2\"\n  output_directory  = \"output_centos_tdhtest\"\n  shutdown_command  = \"echo 'packer' | sudo -S shutdown -P now\"\n  disk_size         = \"5000M\"\n  format            = \"qcow2\"\n  accelerator       = \"kvm\"\n  http_directory    = \"path/to/httpdir\"\n  ssh_username      = \"root\"\n  ssh_password      = \"s0m3password\"\n  ssh_timeout       = \"20m\"\n  vm_name           = \"tdhtest\"\n  net_device        = \"virtio-net\"\n  disk_interface    = \"virtio\"\n  boot_wait         = \"10s\"\n  boot_command      = [\"<tab> text ks=http://{{ .HTTPIP }}:{{ .HTTPPort }}/centos6-ks.cfg<enter><wait>\"]\n}\n\nbuild {\n  sources = [\"source.qemu.example\"]\n}\n```\n\n**JSON**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"builders\": [\n    {\n      \"type\": \"qemu\",\n      \"iso_url\": \"http://mirror.raystedman.net/centos/6/isos/x86_64/CentOS-6.9-x86_64-minimal.iso\",\n      \"iso_checksum\": \"md5:af4a1640c0c6f348c6c41f1ea9e192a2\",\n      \"output_directory\": \"output_centos_tdhtest\",\n      \"shutdown_command\": \"echo 'packer' | sudo -S shutdown -P now\",\n      \"disk_size\": \"5000M\",\n      \"format\": \"qcow2\",\n      \"accelerator\": \"kvm\",\n      \"http_directory\": \"path/to/httpdir\",\n      \"ssh_username\": \"root\",\n      \"ssh_password\": \"s0m3password\",\n      \"ssh_timeout\": \"20m\",\n      \"vm_name\": \"tdhtest\",\n      \"net_device\": \"virtio-net\",\n      \"disk_interface\": \"virtio\",\n      \"boot_wait\": \"10s\",\n      \"boot_command\": [\n        \"<tab> text ks=http://{{ .HTTPIP }}:{{ .HTTPPort }}/centos6-ks.cfg<enter><wait>\"\n      ]\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThis is an example only, and will time out waiting for SSH because we have not\nprovided a kickstart file. You must add a valid kickstart file to the\n\"http_directory\" and then provide the file in the \"boot_command\" in order for\nthis build to run. We recommend you check out the\n[Community Templates](/community-tools#templates)\nfor a practical usage example.\n\nNote that you will need to set `\"headless\": true` if you are running Packer\non a Linux server without X11; or if you are connected via SSH to a remote\nLinux server and have not enabled X11 forwarding (`ssh -X`).\n\n## Qemu Specific Configuration Reference\n\nThere are many configuration options available for the builder. In addition to\nthe items listed here, you will want to look at the general configuration\nreferences for [ISO](#iso-configuration),\n[HTTP](#http-directory-configuration),\n[Floppy](#floppy-configuration),\n[Boot](#boot-configuration),\n[Shutdown](#shutdown-configuration),\n[Communicator](#communicator-configuration)\nconfiguration references, which are\nnecessary for this build to succeed and can be found further down the page.\n\n### Optional:\n\n<!-- Code generated from the comments of the Config struct in builder/qemu/config.go; DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY -->\n\n- `iso_skip_cache` (bool) - Use iso from provided url. Qemu must support\n  curl block device. This defaults to `false`.\n\n- `accelerator` (string) - The accelerator type to use when running the VM.\n  This may be `none`, `kvm`, `tcg`, `hax`, `hvf`, `whpx`, or `xen`. The appropriate\n  software must have already been installed on your build machine to use the\n  accelerator you specified. When no accelerator is specified, Packer will try\n  to use `kvm` if it is available but will default to `tcg` otherwise.\n  \n  ~> The `hax` accelerator has issues attaching CDROM ISOs. This is an\n  upstream issue which can be tracked\n  [here](https://github.com/intel/haxm/issues/20).\n  \n  ~> The `hvf` and `whpx` accelerator are new and experimental as of\n  [QEMU 2.12.0](https://wiki.qemu.org/ChangeLog/2.12#Host_support).\n  You may encounter issues unrelated to Packer when using these.  You may need to\n  add [ \"-global\", \"virtio-pci.disable-modern=on\" ] to `qemuargs` depending on the\n  guest operating system.\n  \n  ~> HAXM is discontinued, and as of Qemu 8.0, the option is deprecated,\n  please consider using another accelerator.\n  \n  -> As an alternative to setting `accelerator`, you can set the `machine` and `accel` args\n  directly using `qemuargs`. For example, to try potential accelerators in order, you could\n  use the following:\n  ```hcl\n  qemuargs = [\n    [\"-machine\", \"type=q35,accel=hvf:kvm:whpx:tcg\"],\n  ]\n\n- `disk_additional_size` ([]string) - Additional disks to create. Uses `vm_name` as the disk name template and\n  appends `-#` where `#` is the position in the array. `#` starts at 1 since 0\n  is the default disk. Each string represents the disk image size in bytes.\n  Optional suffixes 'k' or 'K' (kilobyte, 1024), 'M' (megabyte, 1024k), 'G'\n  (gigabyte, 1024M), 'T' (terabyte, 1024G), 'P' (petabyte, 1024T) and 'E'\n  (exabyte, 1024P)  are supported. 'b' is ignored. Per qemu-img documentation.\n  Each additional disk uses the same disk parameters as the default disk.\n  Unset by default.\n\n- `firmware` (string) - The firmware file to be used by QEMU.\n  If unset, QEMU will load its default firmware.\n  Also see the QEMU documentation.\n  \n  NOTE: when booting in UEFI mode, please use the `efi_` (see\n  [EFI Boot Configuration](#efi-boot-configuration)) options to\n  setup the firmware.\n\n- `use_pflash` (bool) - If a firmware file option was provided, this option can be\n  used to change how qemu will get it.\n  If false (the default), then the firmware is provided through\n  the -bios option, but if true, a pflash drive will be used\n  instead.\n  \n  NOTE: when booting in UEFI mode, please use the `efi_` (see\n  [EFI Boot Configuration](#efi-boot-configuration)) options to\n  setup the firmware.\n\n- `disk_interface` (string) - The interface to use for the disk. Allowed values include any of `ide`,\n  `sata`, `scsi`, `virtio` or `virtio-scsi`^\\*. Note also that any boot\n  commands or kickstart type scripts must have proper adjustments for\n  resulting device names. The Qemu builder uses `virtio` by default.\n  \n  ^\\* Please be aware that use of the `scsi` disk interface has been\n  disabled by Red Hat due to a bug described\n  [here](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1019220). If you are\n  running Qemu on RHEL or a RHEL variant such as CentOS, you *must* choose\n  one of the other listed interfaces. Using the `scsi` interface under\n  these circumstances will cause the build to fail.\n\n- `disk_size` (string) - The size in bytes of the hard disk of the VM. Suffix with the first\n  letter of common byte types. Use \"k\" or \"K\" for kilobytes, \"M\" for\n  megabytes, G for gigabytes, and T for terabytes. If no value is provided\n  for disk_size, Packer uses a default of `40960M` (40 GB). If a disk_size\n  number is provided with no units, Packer will default to Megabytes.\n\n- `skip_resize_disk` (bool) - Packer resizes the QCOW2 image using\n  qemu-img resize.  Set this option to true to disable resizing.\n  Defaults to false.\n\n- `disk_cache` (string) - The cache mode to use for disk. Allowed values include any of\n  `writethrough`, `writeback`, `none`, `unsafe` or `directsync`. By\n  default, this is set to `writeback`.\n\n- `disk_discard` (string) - The discard mode to use for disk. Allowed values\n  include any of unmap or ignore. By default, this is set to ignore.\n\n- `disk_detect_zeroes` (string) - The detect-zeroes mode to use for disk.\n  Allowed values include any of unmap, on or off. Defaults to off.\n  When the value is \"off\" we don't set the flag in the qemu command, so that\n  Packer still works with old versions of QEMU that don't have this option.\n\n- `skip_compaction` (bool) - Packer compacts the QCOW2 image using\n  qemu-img convert.  Set this option to true to disable compacting.\n  Defaults to false.\n\n- `disk_compression` (bool) - Apply compression to the QCOW2 disk file\n  using qemu-img convert. Defaults to false.\n\n- `format` (string) - Either `qcow2` or `raw`, this specifies the output format of the virtual\n  machine image. This defaults to `qcow2`. Due to a long-standing bug with\n  `qemu-img convert` on OSX, sometimes the qemu-img convert call will\n  create a corrupted image. If this is an issue for you, make sure that the\n  the output format matches the input file's format, and Packer will\n  perform a simple copy operation instead. See\n  https://bugs.launchpad.net/qemu/+bug/1776920 for more details.\n\n- `headless` (bool) - Packer defaults to building QEMU virtual machines by\n  launching a GUI that shows the console of the machine being built. When this\n  value is set to `true`, the machine will start without a console.\n  \n  You can still see the console if you make a note of the VNC display\n  number chosen, and then connect using `vncviewer -Shared <host>:<display>`\n\n- `disk_image` (bool) - Packer defaults to building from an ISO file, this parameter controls\n  whether the ISO URL supplied is actually a bootable QEMU image. When\n  this value is set to `true`, the machine will either clone the source or\n  use it as a backing file (if `use_backing_file` is `true`); then, it\n  will resize the image according to `disk_size` and boot it.\n\n- `use_backing_file` (bool) - Only applicable when disk_image is true\n  and format is qcow2, set this option to true to create a new QCOW2\n  file that uses the file located at iso_url as a backing file. The new file\n  will only contain blocks that have changed compared to the backing file, so\n  enabling this option can significantly reduce disk usage. If true, Packer\n  will force the `skip_compaction` also to be true as well to skip disk\n  conversion which would render the backing file feature useless.\n\n- `machine_type` (string) - The type of machine emulation to use. Run your qemu binary with the\n  flags `-machine help` to list available types for your system. This\n  defaults to `pc`.\n  \n  NOTE: when booting a UEFI machine with Secure Boot enabled, this has\n  to be a q35 derivative.\n  If the machine is not a q35 derivative, nothing will boot (not even\n  an EFI shell).\n\n- `memory` (int) - The amount of memory to use when building the VM\n  in megabytes. This defaults to 512 megabytes.\n\n- `net_device` (string) - The driver to use for the network interface. Allowed values `ne2k_pci`,\n  `i82551`, `i82557b`, `i82559er`, `rtl8139`, `e1000`, `pcnet`, `virtio`,\n  `virtio-net`, `virtio-net-pci`, `usb-net`, `i82559a`, `i82559b`,\n  `i82559c`, `i82550`, `i82562`, `i82557a`, `i82557c`, `i82801`,\n  `vmxnet3`, `i82558a` or `i82558b`. The Qemu builder uses `virtio-net` by\n  default.\n\n- `net_bridge` (string) - Connects the network to this bridge instead of using the user mode\n  networking.\n  \n  **NB** This bridge must already exist. You can use the `virbr0` bridge\n  as created by vagrant-libvirt.\n  \n  **NB** This will automatically enable the QMP socket (see QMPEnable).\n  \n  **NB** This only works in Linux based OSes.\n\n- `output_directory` (string) - This is the path to the directory where the\n  resulting virtual machine will be created. This may be relative or absolute.\n  If relative, the path is relative to the working directory when packer\n  is executed. This directory must not exist or be empty prior to running\n  the builder. By default this is output-BUILDNAME where \"BUILDNAME\" is the\n  name of the build.\n\n- `qemuargs` ([][]string) - Allows complete control over the qemu command line (though not qemu-img).\n  Each array of strings makes up a command line switch\n  that overrides matching default switch/value pairs. Any value specified\n  as an empty string is ignored. All values after the switch are\n  concatenated with no separator.\n  \n  ~> **Warning:** The qemu command line allows extreme flexibility, so\n  beware of conflicting arguments causing failures of your run.\n  For instance adding a \"--drive\" or \"--device\" override will mean that\n  none of the default configuration Packer sets will be used. To see the\n  defaults that Packer sets, look in your packer.log\n  file (set PACKER_LOG=1 to get verbose logging) and search for the\n  qemu-system-x86 command. The arguments are all printed for review, and\n  you can use those arguments along with the template engines allowed\n  by qemu-args to set up a working configuration that includes both the\n  Packer defaults and your extra arguments.\n  \n  Another pitfall could be setting arguments like --no-acpi, which could\n  break the ability to send power signal type commands\n  (e.g., shutdown -P now) to the virtual machine, thus preventing proper\n  shutdown.\n  \n  The following shows a sample usage:\n  \n  In HCL2:\n  ```hcl\n    qemuargs = [\n      [ \"-m\", \"1024M\" ],\n      [ \"--no-acpi\", \"\" ],\n      [\n        \"-netdev\",\n        \"user,id=mynet0,\",\n        \"hostfwd=hostip:hostport-guestip:guestport\",\n        \"\"\n      ],\n      [ \"-device\", \"virtio-net,netdev=mynet0\" ]\n    ]\n  ```\n  \n  In JSON:\n  ```json\n    \"qemuargs\": [\n      [ \"-m\", \"1024M\" ],\n      [ \"--no-acpi\", \"\" ],\n      [\n        \"-netdev\",\n        \"user,id=mynet0,\",\n        \"hostfwd=hostip:hostport-guestip:guestport\",\n        \"\"\n      ],\n      [ \"-device\", \"virtio-net,netdev=mynet0\" ]\n    ]\n  ```\n  \n  would produce the following (not including other defaults supplied by\n  the builder and not otherwise conflicting with the qemuargs):\n  \n  ```text\n  qemu-system-x86 -m 1024m --no-acpi -netdev\n  user,id=mynet0,hostfwd=hostip:hostport-guestip:guestport -device\n  virtio-net,netdev=mynet0\"\n  ```\n  \n  ~> **Windows Users:** [QEMU for Windows](https://qemu.weilnetz.de/)\n  builds are available though an environmental variable does need to be\n  set for QEMU for Windows to redirect stdout to the console instead of\n  stdout.txt.\n  \n  The following shows the environment variable that needs to be set for\n  Windows QEMU support:\n  \n  ```text\n  setx SDL_STDIO_REDIRECT=0\n  ```\n  \n  You can also use the `SSHHostPort` template variable to produce a packer\n  template that can be invoked by `make` in parallel:\n  \n  In HCL2:\n  ```hcl\n    qemuargs = [\n      [ \"-netdev\", \"user,hostfwd=tcp::{{ .SSHHostPort }}-:22,id=forward\"],\n      [ \"-device\", \"virtio-net,netdev=forward,id=net0\"]\n    ]\n  ```\n  \n  In JSON:\n  ```json\n    \"qemuargs\": [\n      [ \"-netdev\", \"user,hostfwd=tcp::{{ .SSHHostPort }}-:22,id=forward\"],\n      [ \"-device\", \"virtio-net,netdev=forward,id=net0\"]\n    ]\n  ```\n  \n  `make -j 3 my-awesome-packer-templates` spawns 3 packer processes, each\n  of which will bind to their own SSH port as determined by each process.\n  This will also work with WinRM, just change the port forward in\n  `qemuargs` to map to WinRM's default port of `5985` or whatever value\n  you have the service set to listen on.\n  \n  This is a template engine and allows access to the following variables:\n  `{{ .HTTPIP }}`, `{{ .HTTPPort }}`, `{{ .HTTPDir }}`,\n  `{{ .OutputDir }}`, `{{ .Name }}`, and `{{ .SSHHostPort }}`\n\n- `qemu_img_args` (QemuImgArgs) - A map of custom arguments to pass to qemu-img commands, where the key\n  is the subcommand, and the values are lists of strings for each flag.\n  Example:\n  \n  In HCL:\n  ```hcl\n  qemu_img_args {\n   convert = [\"-o\", \"preallocation=full\"]\n   resize  = [\"-foo\", \"bar\"]\n  }\n  ```\n  In JSON:\n  ```json\n  {\n   \"qemu_img_args\": {\n     \"convert\": [\"-o\", \"preallocation=full\"],\n  \t  \"resize\": [\"-foo\", \"bar\"]\n   }\n  ```\n  Please note\n  that unlike qemuargs, these commands are not split into switch-value\n  sub-arrays, because the basic elements in qemu-img calls are  unlikely\n  to need an actual override.\n  The arguments will be constructed as follows:\n  - Convert:\n  \tDefault is `qemu-img convert -O $format $sourcepath $targetpath`. Adding\n  \targuments [\"-foo\", \"bar\"] to qemu_img_args.convert will change this to\n  \t`qemu-img convert -foo bar -O $format $sourcepath $targetpath`\n  - Create:\n  \tDefault is `create -f $format $targetpath $size`. Adding arguments\n  \t[\"-foo\", \"bar\"] to qemu_img_args.create will change this to\n  \t\"create -f qcow2 -foo bar target.qcow2 1234M\"\n  - Resize:\n  \tDefault is `qemu-img resize -f $format $sourcepath $size`. Adding\n  \targuments [\"-foo\", \"bar\"] to qemu_img_args.resize will change this to\n  \t`qemu-img resize -f $format -foo bar $sourcepath $size`\n\n- `qemu_binary` (string) - The name of the Qemu binary to look for. This\n  defaults to qemu-system-x86_64, but may need to be changed for\n  some platforms. For example qemu-kvm, or qemu-system-i386 may be a\n  better choice for some systems.\n\n- `qmp_enable` (bool) - Enable QMP socket. Location is specified by `qmp_socket_path`. Defaults\n  to false.\n\n- `qmp_socket_path` (string) - QMP Socket Path when `qmp_enable` is true. Defaults to\n  `output_directory`/`vm_name`.monitor.\n\n- `use_default_display` (bool) - If true, do not pass a -display option\n  to qemu, allowing it to choose the default. This may be needed when running\n  under macOS, and getting errors about sdl not being available.\n\n- `vga` (string) - The type of VGA card to emulate. If undefined, this will not be included\n  in the command-line, and the default qemu value for the emulated machine\n  will be picked.\n\n- `display` (string) - What QEMU -display option to use. Defaults to gtk, use none to not pass the\n  -display option allowing QEMU to choose the default. This may be needed when\n  running under macOS, and getting errors about sdl not being available.\n\n- `vnc_bind_address` (string) - The IP address that should be\n  binded to for VNC. By default packer will use 127.0.0.1 for this. If you\n  wish to bind to all interfaces use 0.0.0.0.\n\n- `vnc_use_password` (bool) - Whether or not to set a password on the VNC server. This option\n  automatically enables the QMP socket. See `qmp_socket_path`. Defaults to\n  `false`.\n\n- `vnc_port_min` (int) - The minimum and maximum port\n  to use for VNC access to the virtual machine. The builder uses VNC to type\n  the initial boot_command. Because Packer generally runs in parallel,\n  Packer uses a randomly chosen port in this range that appears available. By\n  default this is 5900 to 6000. The minimum and maximum ports are inclusive.\n  The minimum port cannot be set below 5900 due to a quirk in how QEMU parses\n  vnc display address.\n\n- `vnc_port_max` (int) - VNC Port Max\n\n- `vm_name` (string) - This is the name of the image (QCOW2 or IMG) file for\n  the new virtual machine. By default this is packer-BUILDNAME, where\n  \"BUILDNAME\" is the name of the build. Currently, no file extension will be\n  used unless it is specified in this option.\n\n- `cdrom_interface` (string) - The interface to use for the CDROM device which contains the ISO image.\n  Allowed values include any of `ide`, `scsi`, `virtio` or\n  `virtio-scsi`. The Qemu builder uses `virtio` by default.\n  Some ARM64 images require `virtio-scsi`.\n\n- `vtpm` (bool) - Use a virtual (emulated) TPM device to expose to the VM.\n\n- `use_tpm1` (bool) - Use version 1.2 of the TPM specification for the emulated TPM.\n  \n  By default, we use version 2.0 of the TPM specs for the emulated TPM,\n  if you want to force version 1.2, set this option to true.\n\n- `tpm_device_type` (string) - The TPM device type to inject in the qemu command-line\n  \n  This is required to be specified for some platforms, as the device has to\n  behave differently depending on the architecture.\n  \n  As per the docs:\n  \n   * x86: tpm-tis (default)\n   * ARM: tpm-tis-device\n   * PPC (p-series): tpm-spapr\n\n- `boot_steps` ([][]string) - This is an array of tuples of boot commands, to type when the virtual\n  machine is booted. The first element of the tuple is the actual boot\n  command. The second element of the tuple, which is optional, is a\n  description of what the boot command does. This is intended to be used for\n  interactive installers that requires many commands to complete the\n  installation. Both the command and the description will be printed when\n  logging is enabled. When debug mode is enabled Packer will pause after\n  typing each boot command. This will make it easier to follow along the\n  installation process and make sure the Packer and the installer are in\n  sync. `boot_steps` and `boot_commands` are mutually exclusive.\n  \n  Example:\n  \n  In HCL:\n  ```hcl\n  boot_steps = [\n    [\"1<enter><wait5>\", \"Install NetBSD\"],\n    [\"a<enter><wait5>\", \"Installation messages in English\"],\n    [\"a<enter><wait5>\", \"Keyboard type: unchanged\"],\n  \n    [\"a<enter><wait5>\", \"Install NetBSD to hard disk\"],\n    [\"b<enter><wait5>\", \"Yes\"]\n  ]\n  ```\n  \n  In JSON:\n  ```json\n  {\n    \"boot_steps\": [\n      [\"1<enter><wait5>\", \"Install NetBSD\"],\n      [\"a<enter><wait5>\", \"Installation messages in English\"],\n      [\"a<enter><wait5>\", \"Keyboard type: unchanged\"],\n  \n      [\"a<enter><wait5>\", \"Install NetBSD to hard disk\"],\n      [\"b<enter><wait5>\", \"Yes\"]\n    ]\n  }\n  ```\n\n- `cpu_model` (string) - The CPU model is what will be used by qemu for booting the virtual machine\n  and determine which features of a specific model/family of processors\n  is supported.\n  \n  Any string is supported here, and to see which models are supported\n  by qemu for a specific architecture, refer to `qemu -cpu help`\n  \n  The default value here is that no cpu option will be passed through to qemu,\n  therefore it will default to whichever CPU model is the default for the\n  targetted system (on x86_64 for example, it will be qemu64)\n  \n  NOTE: RHEL9 removed support for `qemu64` in their distributed qemu package,\n  forcing users of RHEL9 on x86_64 systems to define this. \"host\" is a\n  reasonable value if using an hypervisor.\n\n<!-- End of code generated from the comments of the Config struct in builder/qemu/config.go; -->\n\n\n## ISO Configuration\n\n<!-- Code generated from the comments of the ISOConfig struct in multistep/commonsteps/iso_config.go; DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY -->\n\nBy default, Packer will symlink, download or copy image files to the Packer\ncache into a \"`hash($iso_url+$iso_checksum).$iso_target_extension`\" file.\nPacker uses [hashicorp/go-getter](https://github.com/hashicorp/go-getter) in\nfile mode in order to perform a download.\n\ngo-getter supports the following protocols:\n\n* Local files\n* Git\n* Mercurial\n* HTTP\n* Amazon S3\n\nExamples:\ngo-getter can guess the checksum type based on `iso_checksum` length, and it is\nalso possible to specify the checksum type.\n\nIn JSON:\n\n```json\n\n\t\"iso_checksum\": \"946a6077af6f5f95a51f82fdc44051c7aa19f9cfc5f737954845a6050543d7c2\",\n\t\"iso_url\": \"ubuntu.org/.../ubuntu-14.04.1-server-amd64.iso\"\n\n```\n\n```json\n\n\t\"iso_checksum\": \"file:ubuntu.org/..../ubuntu-14.04.1-server-amd64.iso.sum\",\n\t\"iso_url\": \"ubuntu.org/.../ubuntu-14.04.1-server-amd64.iso\"\n\n```\n\n```json\n\n\t\"iso_checksum\": \"file://./shasums.txt\",\n\t\"iso_url\": \"ubuntu.org/.../ubuntu-14.04.1-server-amd64.iso\"\n\n```\n\n```json\n\n\t\"iso_checksum\": \"file:./shasums.txt\",\n\t\"iso_url\": \"ubuntu.org/.../ubuntu-14.04.1-server-amd64.iso\"\n\n```\n\nIn HCL2:\n\n```hcl\n\n\tiso_checksum = \"946a6077af6f5f95a51f82fdc44051c7aa19f9cfc5f737954845a6050543d7c2\"\n\tiso_url = \"ubuntu.org/.../ubuntu-14.04.1-server-amd64.iso\"\n\n```\n\n```hcl\n\n\tiso_checksum = \"file:ubuntu.org/..../ubuntu-14.04.1-server-amd64.iso.sum\"\n\tiso_url = \"ubuntu.org/.../ubuntu-14.04.1-server-amd64.iso\"\n\n```\n\n```hcl\n\n\tiso_checksum = \"file://./shasums.txt\"\n\tiso_url = \"ubuntu.org/.../ubuntu-14.04.1-server-amd64.iso\"\n\n```\n\n```hcl\n\n\tiso_checksum = \"file:./shasums.txt\",\n\tiso_url = \"ubuntu.org/.../ubuntu-14.04.1-server-amd64.iso\"\n\n```\n\n<!-- End of code generated from the comments of the ISOConfig struct in multistep/commonsteps/iso_config.go; -->\n\n\n### Required:\n\n<!-- Code generated from the comments of the ISOConfig struct in multistep/commonsteps/iso_config.go; DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY -->\n\n- `iso_checksum` (string) - The checksum for the ISO file or virtual hard drive file. The type of\n  the checksum is specified within the checksum field as a prefix, ex:\n  \"md5:{$checksum}\". The type of the checksum can also be omitted and\n  Packer will try to infer it based on string length.

Packer will try these in order.\n  If anything goes wrong attempting to download or while downloading a\n  single URL, it will move on to the next. All URLs must point to the same\n  file (same checksum). By default this is empty and `iso_url` is used.\n  Only one of `iso_url` or `iso_urls` can be specified.\n\n- `iso_target_path` (string) - The path where the iso should be saved after download. By default will\n  go in the packer cache, with a hash of the original filename and\n  checksum as its name.\n\n- `iso_target_extension` (string) - The extension of the iso file after download.

The files in this\n  directory will be available over HTTP that will be requestable from the\n  virtual machine. This is useful for hosting kickstart files and so on.\n  By default this is an empty string, which means no HTTP server will be\n  started. The address and port of the HTTP server will be available as\n  variables in `boot_command`. This is covered in more detail below.\n\n- `http_content` (map[string]string) - Key/Values to serve using an HTTP server. `http_content` works like and\n  conflicts with `http_directory`. The keys represent the paths and the\n  values contents, the keys must start with a slash, ex: `/path/to/file`.\n  `http_content` is useful for hosting kickstart files and so on. By\n  default this is empty, which means no HTTP server will be started. The\n  address and port of the HTTP server will be available as variables in\n  `boot_command`.

Because Packer often runs in\n  parallel, Packer will choose a randomly available port in this range to\n  run the HTTP server. If you want to force the HTTP server to be on one\n  port, make this minimum and maximum port the same. By default the values\n  are `8000` and `9000`, respectively.\n\n- `http_port_max` (int) - HTTP Port Max\n\n- `http_bind_address` (string) - This is the bind address for the HTTP server. Defaults to 0.0.0.0 so that\n  it will work with any network interface.\n\n<!-- End of code generated from the comments of the HTTPConfig struct in multistep/commonsteps/http_config.go; -->\n\n\n## Floppy configuration\n\n<!-- Code generated from the comments of the FloppyConfig struct in multistep/commonsteps/floppy_config.go; DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY -->\n\nA floppy can be made available for your build. This is most useful for\nunattended Windows installs, which look for an Autounattend.xml file on\nremovable media. By default, no floppy will be attached. All files listed in\nthis setting get placed into the root directory of the floppy and the floppy\nis attached as the first floppy device. The summary size of the listed files\nmust not exceed 1.44 MB. The supported ways to move large files into the OS\nare using `http_directory` or [the file\nprovisioner](/packer/docs/provisioner/file).\n\n<!-- End of code generated from the comments of the FloppyConfig struct in multistep/commonsteps/floppy_config.go; -->\n\n\n### Optional:\n\n<!-- Code generated from the comments of the FloppyConfig struct in multistep/commonsteps/floppy_config.go; DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY -->\n\n- `floppy_files` ([]string) - A list of files to place onto a floppy disk that is attached when the VM\n  is booted. Currently, no support exists for creating sub-directories on\n  the floppy. Wildcard characters (\\\\*, ?, and \\[\\]) are allowed. Directory\n  names are also allowed, which will add all the files found in the\n  directory to the floppy.\n\n- `floppy_dirs` ([]string) - A list of directories to place onto the floppy disk recursively. This is\n  similar to the `floppy_files` option except that the directory structure\n  is preserved. This is useful for when your floppy disk includes drivers\n  or if you just want to organize it's contents as a hierarchy. Wildcard\n  characters (\\\\*, ?, and \\[\\]) are allowed. The maximum summary size of\n  all files in the listed directories are the same as in `floppy_files`.\n\n- `floppy_content` (map[string]string) - Key/Values to add to the floppy disk. The keys represent the paths, and\n  the values contents. It can be used alongside `floppy_files` or\n  `floppy_dirs`, which is useful to add large files without loading them\n  into memory. If any paths are specified by both, the contents in\n  `floppy_content` will take precedence.\n  \n  Usage example (HCL):\n  \n  ```hcl\n  floppy_files = [\"vendor-data\"]\n  floppy_content = {\n    \"meta-data\" = jsonencode(local.instance_data)\n    \"user-data\" = templatefile(\"user-data\", { packages = [\"nginx\"] })\n  }\n  floppy_label = \"cidata\"\n  ```\n\n- `floppy_label` (string) - Floppy Label\n\n<!-- End of code generated from the comments of the FloppyConfig struct in multistep/commonsteps/floppy_config.go; -->\n\n\n### CD configuration\n\n<!-- Code generated from the comments of the CDConfig struct in multistep/commonsteps/extra_iso_config.go; DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY -->\n\nAn iso (CD) containing custom files can be made available for your build.\n\nBy default, no extra CD will be attached. All files listed in this setting\nget placed into the root directory of the CD and the CD is attached as the\nsecond CD device.\n\nThis config exists to work around modern operating systems that have no\nway to mount floppy disks, which was our previous go-to for adding files at\nboot time.\n\n<!-- End of code generated from the comments of the CDConfig struct in multistep/commonsteps/extra_iso_config.go; -->\n\n\n#### Optional:\n\n<!-- Code generated from the comments of the CDConfig struct in multistep/commonsteps/extra_iso_config.go; DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY -->\n\n- `cd_files` ([]string) - A list of files to place onto a CD that is attached when the VM is\n  booted. This can include either files or directories; any directories\n  will be copied onto the CD recursively, preserving directory structure\n  hierarchy. Symlinks will have the link's target copied into the directory\n  tree on the CD where the symlink was. File globbing is allowed.\n  \n  Usage example (JSON):\n  \n  ```json\n  \"cd_files\": [\"./somedirectory/meta-data\", \"./somedirectory/user-data\"],\n  \"cd_label\": \"cidata\",\n  ```\n  \n  Usage example (HCL):\n  \n  ```hcl\n  cd_files = [\"./somedirectory/meta-data\", \"./somedirectory/user-data\"]\n  cd_label = \"cidata\"\n  ```\n  \n  The above will create a CD with two files, user-data and meta-data in the\n  CD root. This specific example is how you would create a CD that can be\n  used for an Ubuntu 20.04 autoinstall.\n  \n  Since globbing is also supported,\n  \n  ```hcl\n  cd_files = [\"./somedirectory/*\"]\n  cd_label = \"cidata\"\n  ```\n  \n  Would also be an acceptable way to define the above cd. The difference\n  between providing the directory with or without the glob is whether the\n  directory itself or its contents will be at the CD root.\n  \n  Use of this option assumes that you have a command line tool installed\n  that can handle the iso creation. Packer will use one of the following\n  tools:\n  \n    * xorriso\n    * mkisofs\n    * hdiutil (normally found in macOS)\n    * oscdimg (normally found in Windows as part of the Windows ADK)\n\n- `cd_content` (map[string]string) - Key/Values to add to the CD. The keys represent the paths, and the values\n  contents. It can be used alongside `cd_files`, which is useful to add large\n  files without loading them into memory. If any paths are specified by both,\n  the contents in `cd_content` will take precedence.\n  \n  Usage example (HCL):\n  \n  ```hcl\n  cd_files = [\"vendor-data\"]\n  cd_content = {\n    \"meta-data\" = jsonencode(local.instance_data)\n    \"user-data\" = templatefile(\"user-data\", { packages = [\"nginx\"] })\n  }\n  cd_label = \"cidata\"\n  ```\n\n- `cd_label` (string) - CD Label\n\n<!-- End of code generated from the comments of the CDConfig struct in multistep/commonsteps/extra_iso_config.go; -->\n\n\n## Shutdown configuration\n\n### Optional:\n\n<!-- Code generated from the comments of the ShutdownConfig struct in shutdowncommand/config.go; DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY -->\n\n- `shutdown_command` (string) - The command to use to gracefully shut down the machine once all\n  provisioning is complete. By default this is an empty string, which\n  tells Packer to just forcefully shut down the machine. This setting can\n  be safely omitted if for example, a shutdown command to gracefully halt\n  the machine is configured inside a provisioning script. If one or more\n  scripts require a reboot it is suggested to leave this blank (since\n  reboots may fail) and instead specify the final shutdown command in your\n  last script.\n\n- `shutdown_timeout` (duration string | ex: \"1h5m2s\") - The amount of time to wait after executing the shutdown_command for the\n  virtual machine to actually shut down. If the machine doesn't shut down\n  in this time it is considered an error. By default, the time out is \"5m\"\n  (five minutes).\n\n<!-- End of code generated from the comments of the ShutdownConfig struct in shutdowncommand/config.go; -->\n\n\n## Communicator configuration\n\n### Optional common fields:\n\n<!-- Code generated from the comments of the Config struct in communicator/config.go; DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY -->\n\n- `communicator` (string) - Packer currently supports three kinds of communicators:\n  \n  -   `none` - No communicator will be used. If this is set, most\n      provisioners also can't be used.\n  \n  -   `ssh` - An SSH connection will be established to the machine. This\n      is usually the default.\n  \n  -   `winrm` - A WinRM connection will be established.\n  \n  In addition to the above, some builders have custom communicators they\n  can use. For example, the Docker builder has a \"docker\" communicator\n  that uses `docker exec` and `docker cp` to execute scripts and copy\n  files.\n\n- `pause_before_connecting` (duration string | ex: \"1h5m2s\") - We recommend that you enable SSH or WinRM as the very last step in your\n  guest's bootstrap script, but sometimes you may have a race condition\n  where you need Packer to wait before attempting to connect to your\n  guest.\n  \n  If you end up in this situation, you can use the template option\n  `pause_before_connecting`. By default, there is no pause. For example if\n  you set `pause_before_connecting` to `10m` Packer will check whether it\n  can connect, as normal. But once a connection attempt is successful, it\n  will disconnect and then wait 10 minutes before connecting to the guest\n  and beginning provisioning.\n\n<!-- End of code generated from the comments of the Config struct in communicator/config.go; -->\n\n\n<!-- Code generated from the comments of the CommConfig struct in builder/qemu/comm_config.go; DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY -->\n\n- `host_port_min` (int) - The minimum port to use for the Communicator port on the host machine which is forwarded\n  to the SSH or WinRM port on the guest machine. By default this is 2222.\n\n- `host_port_max` (int) - The maximum port to use for the Communicator port on the host machine which is forwarded\n  to the SSH or WinRM port on the guest machine. Because Packer often runs in parallel,\n  Packer will choose a randomly available port in this range to use as the\n  host port. By default this is 4444.\n\n- `skip_nat_mapping` (bool) - Defaults to false. When enabled, Packer\n  does not setup forwarded port mapping for communicator (SSH or WinRM) requests and uses ssh_port or winrm_port\n  on the host to communicate to the virtual machine.\n\n<!-- End of code generated from the comments of the CommConfig struct in builder/qemu/comm_config.go; -->\n\n\n### Optional SSH fields:\n\n<!-- Code generated from the comments of the SSH struct in communicator/config.go; DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY -->\n\n- `ssh_host` (string) - The address to SSH to. This usually is automatically configured by the\n  builder.\n\n- `ssh_port` (int) - The port to connect to SSH. This defaults to `22`.\n\n- `ssh_username` (string) - The username to connect to SSH with. Required if using SSH.\n\n- `ssh_password` (string) - A plaintext password to use to authenticate with SSH.\n\n- `ssh_ciphers` ([]string) - This overrides the value of ciphers supported by default by Golang.\n  The default value is [\n    \"aes128-gcm@openssh.com\",\n    \"chacha20-poly1305@openssh.com\",\n    \"aes128-ctr\", \"aes192-ctr\", \"aes256-ctr\",\n  ]\n  \n  Valid options for ciphers include:\n  \"aes128-ctr\", \"aes192-ctr\", \"aes256-ctr\", \"aes128-gcm@openssh.com\",\n  \"chacha20-poly1305@openssh.com\",\n  \"arcfour256\", \"arcfour128\", \"arcfour\", \"aes128-cbc\", \"3des-cbc\",\n\n- `ssh_clear_authorized_keys` (bool) - If true, Packer will attempt to remove its temporary key from\n  `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` and `/root/.ssh/authorized_keys`. This is a\n  mostly cosmetic option, since Packer will delete the temporary private\n  key from the host system regardless of whether this is set to true\n  (unless the user has set the `-debug` flag). Defaults to \"false\";\n  currently only works on guests with `sed` installed.\n\n- `ssh_key_exchange_algorithms` ([]string) - If set, Packer will override the value of key exchange (kex) algorithms\n  supported by default by Golang. Acceptable values include:\n  \"curve25519-sha256@libssh.org\", \"ecdh-sha2-nistp256\",\n  \"ecdh-sha2-nistp384\", \"ecdh-sha2-nistp521\",\n  \"diffie-hellman-group14-sha1\", and \"diffie-hellman-group1-sha1\".\n\n- `ssh_certificate_file` (string) - Path to user certificate used to authenticate with SSH.\n  The `~` can be used in path and will be expanded to the\n  home directory of current user.\n\n- `ssh_pty` (bool) - If `true`, a PTY will be requested for the SSH connection. This defaults\n  to `false`.\n\n- `ssh_timeout` (duration string | ex: \"1h5m2s\") - The time to wait for SSH to become available. Packer uses this to\n  determine when the machine has booted so this is usually quite long.\n  Example value: `10m`.\n  This defaults to `5m`, unless `ssh_handshake_attempts` is set.\n\n- `ssh_disable_agent_forwarding` (bool) - If true, SSH agent forwarding will be disabled. Defaults to `false`.\n\n- `ssh_handshake_attempts` (int) - The number of handshakes to attempt with SSH once it can connect.\n  This defaults to `10`, unless a `ssh_timeout` is set.\n\n- `ssh_bastion_host` (string) - A bastion host to use for the actual SSH connection.\n\n- `ssh_bastion_port` (int) - The port of the bastion host. Defaults to `22`.\n\n- `ssh_bastion_agent_auth` (bool) - If `true`, the local SSH agent will be used to authenticate with the\n  bastion host. Defaults to `false`.\n\n- `ssh_bastion_username` (string) - The username to connect to the bastion host.\n\n- `ssh_bastion_password` (string) - The password to use to authenticate with the bastion host.\n\n- `ssh_bastion_interactive` (bool) - If `true`, the keyboard-interactive used to authenticate with bastion host.\n\n- `ssh_bastion_private_key_file` (string) - Path to a PEM encoded private key file to use to authenticate with the\n  bastion host. The `~` can be used in path and will be expanded to the\n  home directory of current user.\n\n- `ssh_bastion_certificate_file` (string) - Path to user certificate used to authenticate with bastion host.\n  The `~` can be used in path and will be expanded to the\n  home directory of current user.\n\n- `ssh_file_transfer_method` (string) - `scp` or `sftp` - How to transfer files, Secure copy (default) or SSH\n  File Transfer Protocol.\n  \n  **NOTE**: Guests using Windows with Win32-OpenSSH v9.1.0.0p1-Beta, scp\n  (the default protocol for copying data) returns a a non-zero error code since the MOTW\n  cannot be set, which cause any file transfer to fail. As a workaround you can override the transfer protocol\n  with SFTP instead `ssh_file_transfer_protocol = \"sftp\"`.\n\n- `ssh_proxy_host` (string) - A SOCKS proxy host to use for SSH connection\n\n- `ssh_proxy_port` (int) - A port of the SOCKS proxy. Defaults to `1080`.\n\n- `ssh_proxy_username` (string) - The optional username to authenticate with the proxy server.\n\n- `ssh_proxy_password` (string) - The optional password to use to authenticate with the proxy server.\n\n- `ssh_keep_alive_interval` (duration string | ex: \"1h5m2s\") - How often to send \"keep alive\" messages to the server. Set to a negative\n  value (`-1s`) to disable. Example value: `10s`. Defaults to `5s`.\n\n- `ssh_read_write_timeout` (duration string | ex: \"1h5m2s\") - The amount of time to wait for a remote command to end. This might be\n  useful if, for example, packer hangs on a connection after a reboot.\n  Example: `5m`. Disabled by default.\n\n- `ssh_remote_tunnels` ([]string) - \n\n- `ssh_local_tunnels` ([]string) - \n\n<!-- End of code generated from the comments of the SSH struct in communicator/config.go; -->\n\n\n- `ssh_private_key_file` (string) - Path to a PEM encoded private key file to use to authenticate with SSH.\n  The `~` can be used in path and will be expanded to the home directory\n  of current user.\n\n\n### Optional WinRM fields:\n\n<!-- Code generated from the comments of the WinRM struct in communicator/config.go; DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY -->\n\n- `winrm_username` (string) - The username to use to connect to WinRM.\n\n- `winrm_password` (string) - The password to use to connect to WinRM.\n\n- `winrm_host` (string) - The address for WinRM to connect to.\n  \n  NOTE: If using an Amazon EBS builder, you can specify the interface\n  WinRM connects to via\n  [`ssh_interface`](/packer/integrations/hashicorp/amazon/latest/components/builder/ebs#ssh_interface)\n\n- `winrm_no_proxy` (bool) - Setting this to `true` adds the remote\n  `host:port` to the `NO_PROXY` environment variable. This has the effect of\n  bypassing any configured proxies when connecting to the remote host.\n  Default to `false`.\n\n- `winrm_port` (int) - The WinRM port to connect to. This defaults to `5985` for plain\n  unencrypted connection and `5986` for SSL when `winrm_use_ssl` is set to\n  true.\n\n- `winrm_timeout` (duration string | ex: \"1h5m2s\") - The amount of time to wait for WinRM to become available. This defaults\n  to `30m` since setting up a Windows machine generally takes a long time.\n\n- `winrm_use_ssl` (bool) - If `true`, use HTTPS for WinRM.\n\n- `winrm_insecure` (bool) - If `true`, do not check server certificate chain and host name.\n\n- `winrm_use_ntlm` (bool) - If `true`, NTLMv2 authentication (with session security) will be used\n  for WinRM, rather than default (basic authentication), removing the\n  requirement for basic authentication to be enabled within the target\n  guest. Further reading for remote connection authentication can be found\n  [here](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa384295(v=vs.85).aspx).\n\n<!-- End of code generated from the comments of the WinRM struct in communicator/config.go; -->\n\n\n## Boot Configuration\n\n<!-- Code generated from the comments of the VNCConfig struct in bootcommand/config.go; DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY -->\n\nThe boot command \"typed\" character for character over a VNC connection to\nthe machine, simulating a human actually typing the keyboard.\n\nKeystrokes are typed as separate key up/down events over VNC with a default\n100ms delay. The delay alleviates issues with latency and CPU contention.\nYou can tune this delay on a per-builder basis by specifying\n\"boot_key_interval\" in your Packer template.\n\n<!-- End of code generated from the comments of the VNCConfig struct in bootcommand/config.go; -->\n\n\n<!-- Code generated from the comments of the BootConfig struct in bootcommand/config.go; DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY -->\n\nThe boot configuration is very important: `boot_command` specifies the keys\nto type when the virtual machine is first booted in order to start the OS\ninstaller. This command is typed after boot_wait, which gives the virtual\nmachine some time to actually load.\n\nThe boot_command is an array of strings. The strings are all typed in\nsequence. It is an array only to improve readability within the template.\n\nThere are a set of special keys available. If these are in your boot\ncommand, they will be replaced by the proper key:\n\n-   `<bs>` - Backspace\n\n-   `<del>` - Delete\n\n-   `<enter> <return>` - Simulates an actual \"enter\" or \"return\" keypress.\n\n-   `<esc>` - Simulates pressing the escape key.\n\n-   `<tab>` - Simulates pressing the tab key.\n\n-   `<f1> - <f12>` - Simulates pressing a function key.\n\n-   `<up> <down> <left> <right>` - Simulates pressing an arrow key.\n\n-   `<spacebar>` - Simulates pressing the spacebar.\n\n-   `<insert>` - Simulates pressing the insert key.\n\n-   `<home> <end>` - Simulates pressing the home and end keys.\n\n  - `<pageUp> <pageDown>` - Simulates pressing the page up and page down\n    keys.\n\n-   `<menu>` - Simulates pressing the Menu key.\n\n-   `<leftAlt> <rightAlt>` - Simulates pressing the alt key.\n\n-   `<leftCtrl> <rightCtrl>` - Simulates pressing the ctrl key.\n\n-   `<leftShift> <rightShift>` - Simulates pressing the shift key.\n\n-   `<leftSuper> <rightSuper>` - Simulates pressing the ⌘ or Windows key.\n\n  - `<wait> <wait5> <wait10>` - Adds a 1, 5 or 10 second pause before\n    sending any additional keys. This is useful if you have to generally\n    wait for the UI to update before typing more.\n\n  - `<waitXX>` - Add an arbitrary pause before sending any additional keys.\n    The format of `XX` is a sequence of positive decimal numbers, each with\n    optional fraction and a unit suffix, such as `300ms`, `1.5h` or `2h45m`.\n    Valid time units are `ns`, `us` (or `µs`), `ms`, `s`, `m`, `h`. For\n    example `<wait10m>` or `<wait1m20s>`.\n\n  - `<XXXOn> <XXXOff>` - Any printable keyboard character, and of these\n    \"special\" expressions, with the exception of the `<wait>` types, can\n    also be toggled on or off. For example, to simulate ctrl+c, use\n    `<leftCtrlOn>c<leftCtrlOff>`. Be sure to release them, otherwise they\n    will be held down until the machine reboots. To hold the `c` key down,\n    you would use `<cOn>`. Likewise, `<cOff>` to release.\n\n  - `{{ .HTTPIP }} {{ .HTTPPort }}` - The IP and port, respectively of an\n    HTTP server that is started serving the directory specified by the\n    `http_directory` configuration parameter. If `http_directory` isn't\n    specified, these will be blank!\n\n-   `{{ .Name }}` - The name of the VM.\n\nExample boot command. This is actually a working boot command used to start an\nCentOS 6.4 installer:\n\nIn JSON:\n\n```json\n\"boot_command\": [\n\n\t   \"<tab><wait>\",\n\t   \" ks=http://{{ .HTTPIP }}:{{ .HTTPPort }}/centos6-ks.cfg<enter>\"\n\t]\n\n```\n\nIn HCL2:\n\n```hcl\nboot_command = [\n\n\t   \"<tab><wait>\",\n\t   \" ks=http://{{ .HTTPIP }}:{{ .HTTPPort }}/centos6-ks.cfg<enter>\"\n\t]\n\n```\n\nThe example shown below is a working boot command used to start an Ubuntu\n12.04 installer:\n\nIn JSON:\n\n```json\n\"boot_command\": [\n\n\t\"<esc><esc><enter><wait>\",\n\t\"/install/vmlinuz noapic \",\n\t\"preseed/url=http://{{ .HTTPIP }}:{{ .HTTPPort }}/preseed.cfg \",\n\t\"debian-installer=en_US auto locale=en_US kbd-chooser/method=us \",\n\t\"hostname={{ .Name }} \",\n\t\"fb=false debconf/frontend=noninteractive \",\n\t\"keyboard-configuration/modelcode=SKIP keyboard-configuration/layout=USA \",\n\t\"keyboard-configuration/variant=USA console-setup/ask_detect=false \",\n\t\"initrd=/install/initrd.gz -- <enter>\"\n\n]\n```\n\nIn HCL2:\n\n```hcl\nboot_command = [\n\n\t\"<esc><esc><enter><wait>\",\n\t\"/install/vmlinuz noapic \",\n\t\"preseed/url=http://{{ .HTTPIP }}:{{ .HTTPPort }}/preseed.cfg \",\n\t\"debian-installer=en_US auto locale=en_US kbd-chooser/method=us \",\n\t\"hostname={{ .Name }} \",\n\t\"fb=false debconf/frontend=noninteractive \",\n\t\"keyboard-configuration/modelcode=SKIP keyboard-configuration/layout=USA \",\n\t\"keyboard-configuration/variant=USA console-setup/ask_detect=false \",\n\t\"initrd=/install/initrd.gz -- <enter>\"\n\n]\n```\n\nFor more examples of various boot commands, see the sample projects from our\n[community templates page](https://packer.io/community-tools#templates).\n\n<!-- End of code generated from the comments of the BootConfig struct in bootcommand/config.go; -->\n\n\n### Optional:\n\n<!-- Code generated from the comments of the VNCConfig struct in bootcommand/config.go; DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY -->\n\n- `disable_vnc` (bool) - Whether to create a VNC connection or not. A boot_command cannot be used\n  when this is true. Defaults to false.\n\n- `boot_key_interval` (duration string | ex: \"1h5m2s\") - Time in ms to wait between each key press\n\n<!-- End of code generated from the comments of the VNCConfig struct in bootcommand/config.go; -->\n\n\n<!-- Code generated from the comments of the BootConfig struct in bootcommand/config.go; DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY -->\n\n- `boot_keygroup_interval` (duration string | ex: \"1h5m2s\") - Time to wait after sending a group of key pressses. The value of this\n  should be a duration. Examples are `5s` and `1m30s` which will cause\n  Packer to wait five seconds and one minute 30 seconds, respectively. If\n  this isn't specified, a sensible default value is picked depending on\n  the builder type.\n\n- `boot_wait` (duration string | ex: \"1h5m2s\") - The time to wait after booting the initial virtual machine before typing\n  the `boot_command`. The value of this should be a duration. Examples are\n  `5s` and `1m30s` which will cause Packer to wait five seconds and one\n  minute 30 seconds, respectively. If this isn't specified, the default is\n  `10s` or 10 seconds. To set boot_wait to 0s, use a negative number, such\n  as \"-1s\"\n\n- `boot_command` ([]string) - This is an array of commands to type when the virtual machine is first\n  booted. The goal of these commands should be to type just enough to\n  initialize the operating system installer. Special keys can be typed as\n  well, and are covered in the section below on the boot command. If this\n  is not specified, it is assumed the installer will start itself.\n\n<!-- End of code generated from the comments of the BootConfig struct in bootcommand/config.go; -->\n\n\n## EFI Boot Configuration\n\n<!-- Code generated from the comments of the QemuEFIBootConfig struct in builder/qemu/config.go; DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY -->\n\nBooting in EFI mode\n\nUse these options if wanting to boot on a UEFI firmware, as the options to\ndo so are different from what BIOS (default) booting will require.\n\n<!-- End of code generated from the comments of the QemuEFIBootConfig struct in builder/qemu/config.go; -->\n\n\n### Optional\n\n<!-- Code generated from the comments of the QemuEFIBootConfig struct in builder/qemu/config.go; DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY -->\n\n- `efi_boot` (bool) - Boot in EFI mode instead of BIOS. This is required for more modern\n  guest OS. If either or both of `efi_firmware_code` or\n  `efi_firmware_vars` are defined, this will implicitely be set to `true`.\n  \n  NOTE: when using a Secure-Boot enabled firmware, the machine type has\n  to be q35, otherwise qemu will not boot.\n\n- `efi_firmware_code` (string) - Path to the CODE part of OVMF (or other compatible firmwares)\n  The OVMF_CODE.fd file contains the bootstrap code for booting in EFI\n  mode, and requires a separate VARS.fd file to be able to persist data\n  between boot cycles.\n  \n  Default: `/usr/share/OVMF/OVMF_CODE.fd`\n\n- `efi_firmware_vars` (string) - Path to the VARS corresponding to the OVMF code file.\n  \n  Default: `/usr/share/OVMF/OVMF_VARS.fd`\n\n- `efi_drop_efivars` (bool) - Drop the efivars.fd file in the exported artifact.\n  \n  In addition to the disks created by the builder, we also expose the\n  `efivars.fd` file if the image was booted with UEFI enabled.\n  \n  However, if the output is consumed by a post-processor (like AWS,\n  GCP, etc.), this may not be supported by the code, and since the file\n  is not a disk image, this will error.\n  This option can then be used to remove the `efivars.fd` from the\n  artifact produced by the builder, so it only lists the disks produced\n  instead.\n\n<!-- End of code generated from the comments of the QemuEFIBootConfig struct in builder/qemu/config.go; -->\n\n\n## SMP Configuration\n\n<!-- Code generated from the comments of the QemuSMPConfig struct in builder/qemu/config.go; DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY -->\n\nQemuSMPConfig sets the smp configuration option for the Qemu command-line\n\nThe smp option sets the number of vCPUs to expose to the VM, the final\nnumber of available vCPUs is `sockets * cores * threads`.\n\n<!-- End of code generated from the comments of the QemuSMPConfig struct in builder/qemu/config.go; -->\n\n\n### Optional\n\n<!-- Code generated from the comments of the QemuSMPConfig struct in builder/qemu/config.go; DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY -->\n\n- `cpus` (int) - The number of virtual cpus to use when building the VM.\n  \n  If undefined, the value will either be `1`, or the product of\n  `sockets * cores * threads`\n  \n  If this is defined in conjunction with any topology specifier (sockets,\n  cores and/or threads), the smallest of the two will be used.\n  \n  If the cpu count is the only thing specified, qemu's default behaviour\n  regarding topology will be applied.\n  The behaviour depends on the version of qemu; before version 6.2, sockets\n  were preferred to cores, from version 6.2 onwards, cores are preferred.\n\n- `sockets` (int) - The number of sockets to use when building the VM.\n   The default is `1` socket.\n   The socket count must not be higher than the CPU count.\n\n- `cores` (int) - The number of cores per CPU to use when building the VM.\n   The default is `1` core per CPU.\n\n- `threads` (int) - The number of threads per core to use when building the VM.\n   The default is `1` thread per core.\n\n<!-- End of code generated from the comments of the QemuSMPConfig struct in builder/qemu/config.go; -->\n\n\n### Communicator Configuration\n\n#### Optional:\n\n<!-- Code generated from the comments of the Config struct in communicator/config.go; DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY -->\n\n- `communicator` (string) - Packer currently supports three kinds of communicators:\n  \n  -   `none` - No communicator will be used. If this is set, most\n      provisioners also can't be used.\n  \n  -   `ssh` - An SSH connection will be established to the machine. This\n      is usually the default.\n  \n  -   `winrm` - A WinRM connection will be established.\n  \n  In addition to the above, some builders have custom communicators they\n  can use. For example, the Docker builder has a \"docker\" communicator\n  that uses `docker exec` and `docker cp` to execute scripts and copy\n  files.\n\n- `pause_before_connecting` (duration string | ex: \"1h5m2s\") - We recommend that you enable SSH or WinRM as the very last step in your\n  guest's bootstrap script, but sometimes you may have a race condition\n  where you need Packer to wait before attempting to connect to your\n  guest.\n  \n  If you end up in this situation, you can use the template option\n  `pause_before_connecting`. By default, there is no pause. For example if\n  you set `pause_before_connecting` to `10m` Packer will check whether it\n  can connect, as normal. But once a connection attempt is successful, it\n  will disconnect and then wait 10 minutes before connecting to the guest\n  and beginning provisioning.\n\n<!-- End of code generated from the comments of the Config struct in communicator/config.go; -->\n\n\n### Troubleshooting\n\n#### Invalid Keymaps\n\nSome users have experienced errors complaining about invalid keymaps. This\nseems to be related to having a `common` directory or file in the directory\nthey've run Packer in, like the Packer source directory. This appears to be an\nupstream bug with qemu, and the best solution for now is to remove the\nfile/directory or run in another directory.\n\nSome users have reported issues with incorrect keymaps using qemu version 2.11.\nThis is a bug with qemu, and the solution is to upgrade, or downgrade to 2.10.1\nor earlier.\n\n#### Corrupted image after Packer calls qemu-img convert on OSX\n\nDue to an upstream bug with `qemu-img convert` on OSX, sometimes the qemu-img\nconvert call will create a corrupted image. If this is an issue for you, make\nsure that the the output format (provided using the option `format`) matches\nthe input file's format and file extension, and Packer will\nperform a simple copy operation instead. You will also want to set\n`\"skip_compaction\": true,` and `\"disk_compression\": false` to skip a final\nimage conversion at the end of the build.
